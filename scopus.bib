	abstract = {Background: Rates of breast reconstruction in males with breast cancer have yet to be defined. Despite extensive literature on breast reconstruction in females, a paucity of studies exists for male patients. The aim of this study is to assess the incidence and trends in breast reconstruction in males with breast cancer using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) database. Methods: The 2005 to 2016 NSQIP database was queried to identify males with breast cancer who underwent partial or total mastectomy. Males who underwent post-mastectomy reconstruction were compared to those who did not. Primary outcomes included postoperative complications and mortality. Results: A total of 1,167 males underwent breast surgery, of which 73 (6.3%) underwent reconstruction within 30 days. The majority of patients receiving reconstruction were Caucasian (74.0%) followed by African-American (11.0%), and Asian (5.5%). Asian males had the highest rate of post-mastectomy reconstruction (n = 4, 13.8%). Males who underwent reconstruction had higher rates of postoperative wound dehiscence compared to those who did not undergo reconstruction (2.7% vs. 0%, p = 0.004). The most common reconstructive procedure was implant-based reconstruction (n = 37, 50.7%). African-American males tended to have less implant-based reconstruction than Caucasian (p = 0.057) and Asian males (p = 0.019). African- American males tended to have more free flap reconstruction than Caucasian males (p = 0.034). Conclusions: Post-mastectomy reconstruction is rarely performed in males with breast cancer. Most males undergo implant-based reconstruction, although racial differences exist. Further studies are warranted to assess long-term reconstruction and psychosocial outcomes in males who undergo breast reconstruction.

	abstract = {Common copy number variations often contain cancer-related genes and are likely to play a role in carcinogenesis. Different mechanisms of tumorigenesis are suggested in female and male breast cancer because of different molecular profiles. The cytogenetic analysis of GTG-banded chromosomes was performed in six male patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma and six healthy male controls matched for age. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis was performed in male breast cancer (MBC) patients. Cytogenetic analysis found aberrations previously implicated in cancer. SNP array analysis in patients revealed a gain of Xp11.23, 8p23.2, Yq11.221, Yq11.3 (AZF region), 12p11.21, 18q12.1, and 17q21.3; a loss of Yq11.222 and 7q11.21; and a loss of heterozygosity of 4p16.3, 6p12.3, 6p22.2-p21.31, 7p14.2-14.1, 18q11.2-q12.1, 20p11.23-11.1, 20q11.21-11.23, 1q25.2-q25.3, 2q11.1-q11.2, 5q23.1-23.2, 11p15.4-15.3, and 22q13.1-13.31. Some of these variations, especially those of the Y-chromosome, have not been reported earlier. Chromosomal loci identified by SNP array harbor genes were reported to be associated with cancer progression and metastasis, indicating their involvement in MBC also.  © 2023 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for less than 1% of all breast cancers. Because of this rarity, treatment data is limited to retrospective analyses. The purpose of this paper is to improve awareness of risk factors and the presentation of MBC and to review current data regarding management. Recent Findings: Risk factors for MBC include age, androgen-estrogen imbalance, family history, and genetic predisposition. Palpable mass and nipple changes are the most common manifestation. Delays in diagnosis lead to a higher stage at presentation when compared to women. Most patients have HR-positive disease. Although treatment recommendations for MBC are like female breast cancer, men are more likely to undergo mastectomy and less likely to receive adjuvant therapies. Summary: Additional investigation is warranted to determine optimal management strategies for MBC, including participation in randomized clinical trials. Resources such as gender-specific materials and support services are needed to improve the quality of life after diagnosis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Although similar phenotypically, there is evidence that male and female breast cancer differ in their molecular landscapes. In this systematic review, we consolidated all existing prognostic biomarker data in male breast cancer spanning genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenetics, and phenotypic features of prognostic value from articles published over a 29-year period (March 16, 1992, to May 1, 2021). We identified knowledge gaps in the existing literature, discussed limitations of the included studies, and outlined potential approaches for translational biomarker discovery and validation in male breast cancer. We also recognised STC2, DDX3, and DACH1 as underexploited markers of male-specific prognostic value in breast cancer. Finally, beyond describing the cumulative knowledge on the extensively researched markers oestrogen receptor-α, progesterone receptor, HER2, androgen receptor, and BRCA2, we highlighted ATM, CCND1, FGFR2, GATA3, HIF1-α, MDM2, TP53, and c-Myc as well studied predictors of poor survival that also aligned with several hallmarks of cancer. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Introduction: Prospective data about quality of life (QoL) in men with breast cancer (BC) are lacking. A prospective registry (EORTC10085) of men with all BC stages, including a QoL correlative study, was performed as part of the International Male Breast Cancer Program. Methods: Questionnaires at BC diagnosis included the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 (BC specific module), adapted for men. High functioning and global health/QoL scores indicate high functioning levels/high QoL; high symptom-focused measures scores indicate high symptoms/problems levels. EORTC reference data for healthy men and women with BC were used for comparisons. Results: Of 422 men consenting to participate, 363 were evaluable. Median age was 67 years, and median time between diagnosis and survey was 1.1 months. A total of 114 men (45%) had node-positive early disease, and 28 (8%) had advanced disease. Baseline mean global health status score was 73 (SD: 21), better than in female BC reference data (62, SD: 25). Common symptoms in male BC were fatigue (22, SD: 24), insomnia (21, SD: 28), and pain (16, SD: 23), for which women’s mean scores indicated more burdensome symptoms at 33 (SD: 26), 30 (SD: 32), and 29 (SD: 29). Men’s mean sexual activity score was 31 (SD: 26), with less sexual activity in older patients or advanced disease. Conclusions: QoL and symptom burden in male BC patients appears no worse (and possibly better) than that in female patients. Future analyses on impact of treatment on symptoms and QoL over time, may support tailoring of male BC management. © The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press.},

	abstract = {In the overall population, the incidence of breast cancer in men is lower than in women. Men’s breast cancer awareness is affected both by the low incidence of breast cancer in men and by the presence of a perception that breast cancer can only be seen in women in society. This study aims to determine this awareness and guide future studies on improving social awareness. This study examined male and female patients aged 18 to 75 years who were admitted to our hospital’s general surgery outpatient clinic. A questionnaire containing questions about male breast cancer was administered to the patients, and the study was conducted face-to-face voluntarily. A total of 411 patients, 270 female and 141 male, participated in the study. The results showed that 61.1% of the participants were unaware of the possibility of breast cancer in men. Evaluation of the relationship between awareness and gender revealed that women were more knowledgeable than men (p =.006). Educational status also had a significant influence on awareness (p =.001). Awareness of male breast cancer in society is low. Raising public awareness of this issue will enable men to be diagnosed earlier, at a lower stage, and thus to better respond to treatment, increasing their survival time. © The Author(s) 2023.},

We assessed BC risk in a cohort of 3077 male survivors of 5-year HL treated at age ≤51 years in 20 Dutch hospitals between 1965 and 2013. We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years, and cumulative BC incidences. After a 20-year median follow-up, we observed 8 cases of male with BC. Male survivors of HL experienced a 23-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.1-46.0) increased BC risk compared with the general population, representing 1.6 (95% CI, 0.7-3.3) excess BC incidences per 10 000 person-years. The 20- and 40-year cumulative BC incidences after HL treatment were 0.1% (95% CI, 0.02-0.3) and 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3-1.4), respectively. Treatment with chest radiotherapy without alkylating chemotherapy yielded a strongly increased SIR (20.7; 95% CI, 2.5-74.8), which was not significantly different for chest radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy (41.1; 95% CI, 13.4-96.0). Males treated with chest radiotherapy and anthracyclines had an SIR of 48.1 (95% CI, 13.1-123.1). Two patients died from BC (median follow-up, 4.7 years). To ensure early diagnosis and treatment, clinicians should be alert to BC symptoms in male survivors of HL. © 2023 The American Society of Hematology},

Data on efficacy of CDK 4/6 inhibitors, which are the mainstay of treatment for hormone receptor–positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, are lacking in male patients. Case report: We present a clinical case of prolonged benefit from palbociclib in combination with letrozole and LHRH analogue in a man who had previously been treated with six lines of endocrine therapies and chemotherapy regimens but was still in excellent clinical condition. Conclusions: This clinical case demonstrates that male breast cancer stands out as an endocrine-sensitive disease, which could potentially benefit from CDK 4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine agents even in very heavily pretreated settings of disease, underscoring both the importance of an accurate selection of patients for later treatment lines, taking into account disease history and previous treatment responses, and the peculiarity of breast cancer in men, which deserves dedicated clinical trials to tailor future recommendations. © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2020.},

Contralateral breast cancer diagnosed within 12 months of the prior breast cancer is known as bilateral synchronous breast cancer. Bilateral, synchronous male breast cancer is extremely rare and consequently there are few publications describing imaging findings of synchronous bilateral male breast cancer. We aim to raise awareness about this rare entity by presenting the clinical and pathologic findings of a 64-year-old male case with synchronous bilateral breast cancer using multimodality imaging techniques including magnetic resonance imaging. Increasing awareness of the disease will prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment.  © 2022 by the the Turkish Federation of Breast Diseases Societies.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer represents about 1% of all breast cancer diagnoses and, although there are some similarities between male and female breast cancer, the paucity of data available on male breast cancer makes it difficult to establish targeted therapies. To date, most male breast cancers (MBCs) are treated according to protocols established for female breast cancer (FBC). Thus, defining the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of MBC with improved resolution is critical for developing better avenues for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we present matched transcriptional (scRNA-seq) and epigenetic (scATAC-seq) profiles at single-cell resolution of two treatment naïve MBC tumors processed immediately after surgical resection. These data enable the detection of differentially expressed genes between male and female breast tumors across immune, stromal, and malignant cell types, to highlight several genes that may have therapeutic implications. Notably, MYC target genes and mTORC1 signaling genes were significantly upregulated in the malignant cells of MBC compared to the female counterparts. To understand how the regulatory landscape of MBC gives rise to these male-specific gene expression patterns, we leveraged the scATAC-seq data to systematically link changes in chromatin accessibility to changes in gene expression within each cell type. We observed cancer-specific rewiring of several salient enhancers and posit that these enhancers have a higher regulatory load than lineage-specific enhancers. We highlight two examples of previously unannotated cancer-cell-specific enhancers of ANXA2 and PRDX4 gene expression and show evidence for super-enhancer regulation of LAMB3 and CD47 in male breast cancer cells. Overall, this dataset annotates clinically relevant regulatory networks in male breast tumors, providing a useful resource that expands our current understanding of the gene expression programs that underlie the biology of MBC. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {RecurIndex, a multigene profiling assay, can predict the risk of local recurrence and distant metastasis in female breast cancer (FBC), but its role in male breast cancer (MBC) remains unclear. In this study, the clinicopathological data of 43 consecutive MBC patients undergoing surgeries between 2009 and 2018 were retrospectively analysed. Their paraffin-embedded tissue sections were examined by RecurIndex test which comprised 2 models: recurrence index for local recurrence (RI-LR) and recurrence index for distant recurrence (RI-DR). Of 43 patients, there were 26 low-risk and 17 high-risk patients assessed by RI-LR, while 17 low-risk and 26 high-risk patients by RI-DR. For RI-LR, tumor N stage showed statistically significant (P < 0.001) between low- and high-risk patients; for RI-DR, differences were pronounced in tumor grade (P = 0.033), T stage (P = 0.043) and N stage (P = 0.003). In terms of clinical outcomes, the overall survival (OS) of low- and high-risk patients stratified by RI-LR showed no statistically significant differences (P = 0.460), while high-risk patients identified by RI-DR had a significantly worse distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) (P = 0.035), progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.019) and OS (P = 0.044) than low-risk patients. Overall, RI-DR can effectively predict the DRFS, PFS and OS of MBC patients and identify those at low risk of recurrence, which may serve as a potential prognostic tool for MBC. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: This study aimed to investigate the role of postoperative radiation therapy in a large population-based cohort of patients with stage I–III male breast cancer (MaBC). Methods: Patients with stage I–III breast cancer treated with surgery were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer database from 2010 to 2015. Multivariate logistic regression identified the predictors of radiation therapy administration. Multivariate Cox regression model was used to evaluate the predictors of survival. Results: We identified 1321 patients. Age, stage, positive regional nodes, surgical procedure, and HER2 status were strong predictors of radiation therapy administration. There was no difference between patients who received radiation therapy and those who did not (P = 0.46); however, after propensity score matching, it was associated with improved OS (P = 0.04). In the multivariate analysis of the unmatched cohort, the factors associated with better OS were administration of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In the subset analysis of the unmatched cohort, postoperative radiation therapy was associated with improved OS in men undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS), with four or more node-positive or larger primary tumours (T3/T4). Furthermore, we found no benefit of radiation therapy, regardless of the type of axillary surgery in mastectomy (MS). In older MaBC patients with T1-2N1 who underwent MS, radiation therapy showed no significant effects, regardless of chemotherapy. Conclusion: Postoperative radiation therapy could improve the survival of MaBC patients undergoing BCS, with four or more node-positive or larger primary tumours. Moreover, it should be carefully considered in patients undergoing MS and older T1-2N1 patients. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: Several male breast cancer (MBC) susceptibility genes have been identified, but the MBC risk for individuals with a pathogenic variant in each of these genes (i.e., penetrance) remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting the penetrance of MBC susceptibility genes to better summarize current estimates of penetrance. Methods: A search query was developed to identify MBC-related papers indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE. A validated natural language processing method was applied to identify papers reporting penetrance estimates. These penetrance studies’ bibliographies were reviewed to ensure comprehensiveness. We accessed the potential ascertainment bias for each enrolled study. Results: Fifteen penetrance studies were identified from 12,182 abstracts, covering five purported MBC susceptibility genes: ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, and PALB2. Cohort (n = 6, 40%) and case–control (n = 5, 33%) studies were the two most common study designs, followed by family-based (n = 3, 20%), and a kin-cohort study (n = 1, 7%). Seven of the 15 studies (47%) adjusted for ascertainment adequately and therefore the MBC risks reported by these seven studies can be considered applicable to the general population. Based on these seven studies, we found pathogenic variants in ATM, BRCA2, CHEK2 c.1100delC, and PALB2 show an increased risk for MBC. The association between BRCA1 and MBC was not statistically significant. Conclusion: This work supports the conclusion that pathogenic variants in ATM, BRCA2, CHEK2 c.1100delC, and PALB2 increase the risk of MBC, whereas pathogenic variants in BRCA1 may not be associated with increased MBC risk. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is a well-recognised late adverse effect in female childhood cancer survivors (CCSs), especially after chest radiotherapy; information on subsequent male breast cancer (SMBC) is limited. We summarised the existing evidence on SMBC after childhood cancer in a systematic review and investigated the risk of SMBC among males in a Pan-European cohort. Methods: We searched Medline/PubMed for cohort studies and case reports/series that assessed SMBC after childhood cancer (≤21 years). Furthermore, we analysed data on SMBC in the PanCareSurFup cohort, reporting standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), absolute excess risks (AERs), and 5- and 10-year survival rates. Results: The systematic review included 38 of 7080 potentially eligible articles. Cohort-specific SMBC frequencies were 0–0.40% (31 studies). SMBC occurred after a follow-up ranging from 24.0 to 42.0 years. Nine case reports/series described 11 SMBC cases, occurring 11.0–42.5 years after primary childhood cancer. In the PanCareSurFup cohort (16 SMBC/37,738 males; 0.04%), we observed a 22.3-fold increased risk of SMBC relative to the general male population (95% CI 12.7–36.2; absolute excess risk/100,000 person-years: 2.3, 95% CI 1.3–3.7). The five- and ten-year survival rates after SMBC diagnosis were 60.3% (95% CI 35.6%–85.0%) and 43.0% (95% CI 16.1%–69.9%), respectively. Clear evidence of risk factors did not emerge from these comprehensive efforts. Conclusions: Compared to the general population, male CCSs have an elevated risk of developing subsequent breast cancer, although the absolute risk is low. Health care providers should be aware of this rare yet serious late effect; male CCSs with symptoms potentially related to SMBC warrant careful examination. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Introduction: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare malignancy that accounts for less than 1% of all cancers in men and less than 1% of all breast cancers worldwide. Understandably, due to the low incidence of this rare cancer, there is a lack of prospective clinical data. The aim of this retrospective study was the analysis of therapy-induced toxicities as well as the assessment of psychological distress in the affected men during oncological inpatient rehabilitation. Methods: Fifty-one MBC patients were evaluated for the presence of treatment-induced side effects, toxicities, and psychological distress (using German version of the 11-stage NCCN distress thermometer; cut-off ≥5) during oncological indoor rehabilitation. The collected data were checked for correlation with sociodemographic and clinical factors (SPSS 22). Results: The mean age was 62.0 ± 10.6 years, in 96% a hormone-dependent breast tumor (ER+), and in over 75%, overweight or obesity (BMI >25/>30) was diagnosed. Most reported side effects included weakness/fatigue (74.5%), arthralgia after surgery/chemotherapy (43.1%), chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy (36.3%), and/or lymphedema (13.7%). Psychological distress was detected in 24 cases (47.0%; ≥5), in 13 cases even with significantly high levels (25.5%; ≥7). There was no correlation between psychological distress and clinical factors such as age, performed treatment (e.g., chemotherapy), or therapy-induced side effects (e.g., lymphedema) in our small collective. Conclusions: Psychological distress and somatic side effects are common in MBC. These data demonstrate the importance of routine screening for psychological distress and the high need for psycho-oncological therapy (regardless of gender) in multimodal oncological rehabilitation.  © 2022 },

	abstract = {As one of the India’s rarest kinds of cancer, Male Breast Cancer (MBC) manifests in late presentation, delayed diagnosis, often in the terminal stage, and shock because of a complete unawareness and lack of prior knowledge about the existence of such a disease. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 6 MBC patients of whom 5 patients died within 7–16 months after their respective diagnosis, 9 members of their families, and 5 physicians, this study has revealed that dying with MBC in India is doubly stigmatised as the patients with cancer, which is perceived as a stigma itself, have been diagnosed with an illness of supposed feminine organ, that challenges the masculine identity of the patients. The sense of shame and stigma often results in concealment of the reality from others, and in some instances, the family members also practice complete nondisclosure to the MBC patients themselves to protect them from the sense of ‘indignity’ associated with a ‘woman’s disease’. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Objective: Published studies on male breast cancer (MBC) and BRCA mutations are scarce and usually include, a small number of patients. The clinicopathological characteristics of BRCA mutant and wild-type MBC patients were compared in more than forty patients in this study. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of MBC patients' clinical and histopathological data was conducted. To compare the patients' characteristics, chi-square test and Fisher's Exact test were utilized. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to examine the survival analysis. Results: In total 43 cases were reviewed. The average duration of follow-up was 35.8 months. BRCA mutations were found in 11 (25.6%) of the patients. BRCA1 mutations were found in four patients (9.3%), BRCA2 mutations in six patients (14%), and BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in one patient (2.3%). The median age at diagnosis was 58 years old, and there was no statistically significant difference between groups (p = 0.7). Tumor location (p = 0.3), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression (p = 0.5), estrogen receptor status (p = 0.05), progesterone receptor status (p = 0.6), tumor stage (p = 0.9), lymph node positivity (p = 0.5), tumor histology (p = 0.06), and recurrence status (p = 0.6) were similar between BRCA-wild type and -mutated patients. Overall survival averaged 115.6 months (range: 76.0-155.3), with no statistically significant differences between groups (p = 0.6). Conclusion: This study investigated clinical and pathological characteristics and prognoses of BRCA wild and mutant-type MBC and these were similar in all groups studied.  © 2022 by the Turkish Federation of Breast Diseases Societies.},

	abstract = {Background: Bone metastases (BM) from malignant tumors could disrupt the balance between osteoclasts and osteoblasts and affect bone homeostasis. Malignant breast cancer (BC) is rare in male patients, and co-occurrence of BM is even rarer. Given its low incidence, there is limited research evaluating risk and prognosis. Despite the widespread application of nomograms to predict uncommon malignancies, no studies have constructed predictive models focusing on the diagnosis and prognosis of male breast cancer with bone metastases (MBCBM). Methods: This study selected all male breast cancer patients (MBC) between 2010 and 2019 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. We used simple and multivariate Logistic regression analyses to identify independent risk factors for BM in MBC patients. Then simple and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed to determine the independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in MBCBM patients. We established and validated three new nomograms based on these independent factors. Result: A total of 4187 MBC patients were included, with 191 (4.56%) having bone metastases at the time of diagnosis. The independent risk factors of BM in MBC patients included age, tumor size, marital status, T stage, and N stage. In MBCBM patients, independent prognostic factors for OS and CSS were both age, T stage, ER status, PR status, and surgery. The concordance index (C-index), the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the calibration curve, and the decision curve analysis (DCA) confirmed that these three nomograms could accurately predict the diagnosis and prognosis of MBCBM patients with excellent discrimination and clinical utility superior to the TNM staging system. We then established two prognostic-based risk stratification systems and three visualized dynamic nomograms that could be applied in clinical practice. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study aimed to establish and validate an accurate novel nomogram to objectively predict the diagnosis and prognosis of MBCBM patients. On this basis, prognostic-based risk stratification systems and visualized dynamic nomograms were constructed to facilitate doctors and patients to quantify individual BM risk probability and survival probability to assist in personalized risk assessment and clinical decision-making.

After progressing to first line therapy, the molecular platform EPICUP® was performed and the results suggested breast cancer as origin, although non breast primary tumor was found by imaging techniques; and the patient was treated according to this origin. During the evolution of the disease a nodule appeared in the left breast, and a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of an infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Male breast cancer (MBC) represents an infrequent and heterogeneous disease, but TNBC in men represents less than 0.02% of total breast cancer cases. Unfortunately, there is no standard of care for MBC, and due to the development of new treatment strategies are focused on women BC, there are less opportunities to participate in clinical trials for MBC. Through the review of a clinical case, we show how the molecular platform could help in finding the origin of the CUP. Moreover, further coordinated multicenter international collaboration is necessary to conduct larger and successful therapeutic clinical trials in MBC, and specifically, male TNBC trials to better understand this rare entity and guide future management strategies. © 2021},

Methodology: The population target has been male corpses without clinical expression of breast cancer. Seventy-four male corpses have been submitted to bilateral subcutaneous radical mastectomy. Samples have been submitted to echography and mammography imaging and every lesion superior to BI-RADS 4a has been excised. Results: One excisional biopsy has been performed and no case of breast cancer has been identified. Discussion: Our findings suggest that screening of the general population for male breast cancer is not necessary. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a relatively rare disease, but emerging data recommend the development of novel therapeutics considering its alarming threats. Compared to female breast cancer (FBC), MBC is reportedly associated with inferior outcomes (poor survival) owing to their late diagnosis and lack of adequate treatment. Treatment typically correlates with FBC, involving surgical removal of the breast tissue along with chemo/hormonal/radiation therapy, the tamoxifen being a standard adjuvant. Considering the distinct immunophenotypic (implying different pathogenesis and progression) differences from FBC, the identification of diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics for MBC is highly desirable. In this context, we have analyzed the most deleterious nsSNPs of BRCA2, a human tumor suppressor gene constituting the potential biomarker for tumors including MBC, to predict the structural changes associated with the mutants hampering the normal protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, resulting in MBC progression. Among 27 nsSNPs confined to 21 rsIDs pertaining to MBC, the 19 nsSNPs constituting 14 rsIDs have been predicted as highly deleterious. We believe that these nsSNPs could serve as potential biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes and could be the pivotal target for MBC drug discovery. Subsequently, the study highlights the exploration of the key nsSNPs (of BRCA2 associated with the MBC) and its applications toward the identification of therapeutic hit TIP006136 following the homology modeling, virtual screening of 5284 phytochemicals retrieved from the TIPdb (a database of phytochemicals from indigenous plants in Taiwan) database, molecular docking (against native and mutant BRCA2), dynamic simulations (against native and mutant BRCA2), density functional theory (DFT), and molecular electrostatic potential. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to use diverse computational modules to investigate the important nsSNPs of BRCA2 related to MBC, implying that TIP006136 could be a potential hit and must be studied further (in vitro and in vivo) to establish its anticancer property and efficacy against MBC.  © },

	abstract = {Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of male breast is a rare lesion, often associated with invasive carcinoma. When the in situ component is present in pure form, histological grade is usually low or intermediate. Imaging is difficult as gynaecomastia is often present and can mask underlying findings. We report a rare case of pure high-grade DCIS in a young male patient, with associated intraductal papilloma and atypical ductal hyperplasia. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) showed an area of architectural distortion at the union of outer quadrants of the left breast without gynaecomastia. Triple assessment suggested performing a nipple-sparing mastectomy, which revealed the presence of a focal area of high-grade DCIS of 2 mm. DCIS, even of high grade, is difficult to detect with mammography and even more rare, especially when associated with other proliferative lesions. DBT with 2D synthetic reconstruction is useful as the imaging step of a triple assessment and it should be performed in both symptomatic and asymptomatic high-risk men to differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. We propose a diagnostic model to early detect breast cancer in men, optimizing resources according to efficiency, effectiveness and economy, and look forward to radiomics as a powerful tool to help radiologists. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Introduction: The 21-gene assay provides prognostication for estrogen receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (ER+/HER2-) early female breast cancer patients. This signature has not been validated in male breast cancer (MBC). Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in accordance to the PRISMA guidelines. Retrospective cohort studies comparing 21-gene assay scores in female and MBC were included. Dichotomous variables were pooled as odds ratios (OR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the Mantel–Haenszel method. Results: Six studies including 176,338 patients were included (mean age of 63.4 years, range: 33–88). Of these, 1.0% had MBC (1826/176,338) and 99.0% were female patients (174,512/176,338). MBC patients were more likely to have increased tumour stage, nodal involvement, and grade 3 disease (all P < 0.001) In MBC patients, the mean score was 18.8 (range: 11–26) vs. 13.4 (range 0–33) in female patients (P < 0.001). In MBC patients, 22.4% had scores >30 (408/1822) versus 18.3% in female patients (31,852/174,500). In female patients, 52.0% had scores <18 (90,787/174,500) versus 47.8% in MBC (471/1822). Overall, patients with female patients were as likely to have scores <18 (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.94–1.16), scores 18–30 (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00–1.26) and scores >30 (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.45–1.07) as MBC patients. Conclusion: There are similar anticipated scores for female and MBC undergoing 21-gene expression assay testing for early stage, ER+/HER2-breast cancer. In the absence of stage matching, cautious interpretation of these results is required. Validation of the 21-gene assay in MBC is still required. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer mortality in women has declined statistically significantly over the past several years. In men, it is unclear whether survival has changed over time. We evaluated changes in breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) in male breast cancer over the past 3 decades. METHODS: We evaluated men diagnosed with breast cancer between 1988 and 2017, reported in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. Patients were categorized into 3 groups by year of diagnosis: 1988-1997, 1998-2007, and 2008-2017. BCSS and OS were estimated by Kaplan-Meier, and differences between groups were compared by log-rank test. Multivariable Cox regression evaluated the independent association of year of diagnosis with BCSS and OS. All tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: We included 8481 men. Overall, BCSS at 5 years was 83.69%, 83.78%, and 84.41% in groups 1988-1997, 1998-2007, and 2008-2017, respectively (P = .86). There was no statistically significant difference in BCSS between the 3 groups within each stage of disease. Among all patients, OS at 5 years was 64.61%, 67.31%, and 69.05% in groups 1988-1997, 1998-2007, and 2008-2017, respectively (P = .01). In adjusted Cox models, each additional year of diagnosis had no statistically significant association with BCSS (hazard ratio = 1.00, 95% confidence interval = 0.99 to 1.01, P = .75), but there was statistically significant improvement in OS (hazard ratio = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98 to 0.99, P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 3 decades, there has been no statistically significant improvement in BCSS in male breast cancer. Changes in OS over time are consistent with increasing life expectancy. Efforts to improve BCSS in male breast cancer are warranted. © The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

	abstract = {This study evaluated the incidence, the survival outcomes and its prognostic factors for male breast cancer (MBC) in Korea. Using the National Health Insurance Service database of Korea, we identified MBC patients who had the new claim code of C50. Medical records including type of surgeries and radiotherapy within one year of the first claim and death records were reviewed. Between 2005 and 2016, 838 newly diagnosed MBC patients were included (median follow-up, 1,769 days). The 70–74-year age group had the highest incidence of MBC. The 5-year survival rate was 73.7%. Age > 65 years, low income, no surgical intervention, no tamoxifen use, and > 2 comorbidities correlated with a worse outcome. MBC incidence has increased over time, and its peak is noted at age > 70 years. Age > 65 years, > 2 comorbidities, no surgical intervention, and no tamoxifen use correlate to poor prognosis. © 2021 Korean Breast Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for 0.5% to 1% of all breast cancers diagnosed annually. The purpose of this study is to evaluate prognostic factors in MBC. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with MBC between 2010 and 2021. Demographics, comorbidities, cancer characteristics, recurrence, and mortality were collected. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine prognostic factors. A Kaplan–Meier curve was used to plot survival probabilities. Results: A total of 47 male patients were identified. The mean age at presentation was 64.1 y. Twenty eight (59.6%) patients were African American and 14 patients (29.8%) were Caucasian. Most patients had invasive ductal carcinoma (89.4%) and presented with T1 or T2 tumors (40.4% and 38.3%, respectively). Three patients (6.4%) had a recurrence and eight patients (17%) died. Using mortality as an end point, age (≥ 76.1 y) indicated a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.13 (P = 0.004), diabetes mellitus (HR = 5.45, P = 0.023), atrial fibrillation (HR = 8.0, P = 0.009), end-stage renal disease (HR 6.47, P = 0.023), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 3 (HR = 7.92, P = 0.024), poorly differentiated grade (HR = 7.21, P = 0.033), and metastatic disease (HR = 30.94, P = 0.015) had an increased risk of mortality. Overall survival at 3 y was 79.2%. Conclusions: Advanced age, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 3, poorly differentiated tumors, and metastatic disease are unfavorable prognostic factors in MBC. Compared to female breast cancer, MBC showed poorer overall survival. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: The independent and joint association of metformin and testosterone replacement therapy (TTh) with the incidence of prostate, colorectal, and male breast cancers remain poorly understood, including the investigation of the risk of these cancers combined (HRCs, hormone-associated cancers) among men of different racial and ethnic background. Methods: In 143,035 men (≥ 65 yrs old) of SEER-Medicare 2007–2015, we identified White (N = 110,430), Black (N = 13,520) and Other Race (N = 19,085) men diagnosed with incident HRC. Pre-diagnostic prescription of metformin and TTh was ascertained for this analysis. Weighted multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were conducted. Results: We found independent and joint associations of metformin and TTh with incident prostate (odds ratio [OR]joint = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36–0.54) and colorectal cancers (ORjoint = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34–0.64), but not with male breast cancer. There were also inversed joint associations of metformin and TTh with HRCs (ORjoint = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.38–0.54). Similar reduced associations with HRCs were identified among White, Black, and Other Race men. Conclusion: Pre-diagnostic use of metformin and TTh were, independently and jointly, inversely associated with incident prostate and colorectal cancers. The risk of HRCs was also reduced among White, Black and Other Race men. Greatest reduced associations of prostate and colorectal cancers and HRCs were mainly observed in combination of metformin and TTh. Larger studies are needed to confirm the independent and joint association of metformin plus TTh with these cancers in understudied and underserved populations. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Despite increasing awareness programs targeting women, most people are unaware that breast cancer can also affect men. Our purpose is to assess the knowledge, perception, and awareness of male breast cancer among the adult male population. A descriptive cross-sectional survey included 128 male employees who agreed to participate in our study. We distributed pre-validated questionnaires to participants and gathered data following the one-on-one interview. The mean age of the participants was 37.71 years with a standard deviation of 7.65. About 55.5% of the participants were unaware that changes in the nipple position could be a sign of breast cancer. Majority of the participants, i.e., 60.9% believe positive family history will not increase the risk of breast cancer and 93% of participants have no idea about self-breast examination to detect lumps. On the other hand, 33.6% of participants stated that diagnosis and treatment of male breast cancer is embarrassing. Majority of the participants have no idea about the screening methods, 59.4% of participants have not heard about mammography, which is considered a modality of choice for early detection of breast cancer. The male university staff were lacking in knowledge and awareness about male breast cancer. In Indian community, because of shyness, they feel very embarrassed when it comes to openly discussing breast cancer. Because of this, it needs to receive more attention and to educate the male population about male breast cancer. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Microcalcifications (MCs) are important disease markers for breast cancer. Many studies were conducted on their characterization in female breast cancer (FBC), but no information is available on their composition in male breast cancer (MBC). Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a molecular spectroscopy that can rapidly explore the biochemical composition of MCs without requiring any staining protocol. In this study, we optimized an algorithm to identify the mineral components present in MCs from Raman images. The algorithm was then used to study and compare MCs identified on breast cancer pieces from male and female patients. In total, we analyzed 41 MCs from 5 invasive MBC patients and 149 MCs from 13 invasive FBC patients. Results show that hydroxyapatite is the most abundant type of calcium both in MBC and FBC. However, some differences in the amount and distribution of calcium minerals are present between the two groups. Besides, we observed that MCs in MBC have a higher amount of organic material (collagen) than FBC. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first overview of the composition of MCs present in MBC patients; and suggests that these patients have specific features that differentiate them from the previously studied FBC. Our result support thus the need for studies designed explicitly to the understanding of MBC. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to build a prediction model for male breast cancer (MBC) patients to predict the possibility of distant metastasis. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to obtain data on patients with MBC. The patients were divided into a training set and a validation set at a ratio of 7:3. The risk variables of distant metastasis in the training set were determined by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. And then we integrated those risk factors to construct the nomogram. The prediction nomogram was further verified in the verification set. The discrimination and calibration of the nomogram were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration plots, respectively. A total of 1974 patients (1381 in training set and 593 in validation set) were eligible for final inclusion, of whom 149 (7.55%) had distant metastasis at the diagnosed time. Multivariate logistic regression analyses presented that age, T stage, N stage, and hormone receptor status were independent risk factors for distant metastasis at initial diagnosis of male breast cancer. Finally, the 4 variables were combined to construct the nomogram. The area under the curve values for the nomogram established in the training set and validation set were 0.8224 (95%CI: 0.7796-0.8652) and 0.8631 (95%CI: 0.7937-0.9326), suggesting that the nomogram had good predictive power. The calibration plots illustrated an acceptable correlation between the prediction by nomogram and the actual observation, as the calibration curve was closed to the diagonal bisector line. An easy-to-use nomogram, being proven to be with reliable discrimination ability and accuracy, was established to predict distant metastasis for male patients with breast cancer using the easily available risk factors. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Introduction: Less than 1% of all breast cancers are diagnosed in males. In females, postmastectomy breast reconstruction is associated with increased patient satisfaction. However, there is a paucity of literature describing reconstructive options for postmastectomy deformity in the male chest. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate postmastectomy reconstruction outcomes in males with breast cancer. Methods: A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were queried for records pertaining to the study question using medical subject heading (MeSH) terms such as "male breast cancer," "mastectomy," and "reconstruction." No limitations were placed on the year of publication, country of origin, or study size. Study characteristics and patient demographics were collected. Primary outcomes of interest included postoperative complications, recurrence rate, and mortality rate. Results: A total of 11 articles examining 29 male patients with breast cancer who underwent postmastectomy reconstruction were included for analysis. Literature was most commonly available in the form of case reports. The average age was 59.6 +/-11.4 years. Reconstruction methods included fat grafting (n = 1, 3.4%), silicone implants (n = 1, 3.4%), and autologous chest wall reconstruction with local flaps (n = 26, 89.7%). Postoperative complications occurred in two patients (6.8%), including partial nipple necrosis (n = 1) and hypertrophic scarring (n = 1). Of the studies reporting patient satisfaction, all patients were pleased with the aesthetic appearance of their chest. Conclusion: This systematic review revealed the limited availability of research regarding postmastectomy chest reconstruction in males with breast cancer. Nevertheless, the evidence available suggests that reconstruction can restore a patient's body image and, thus, should be regularly considered and discussed with male patients. Larger studies are warranted to further shed light on this population. Copyright © 2022 Romina Deldar et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is standard for many females with breast cancer (FBC). The efficacy of NAC in male breast cancer (MaBC) is unclear. The aim of this study was to compare proportions of pathologic complete response (pCR) between MaBC and FBC by tumor subtype (TS). Methods: MaBC and FBC treated with NAC between 2010 and 2016, with known TS, were evaluated from the National Cancer Database. Proportions of pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) were compared between sexes within TS by Fisher test. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the independent association of sex with pCR. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan–Meier. Results: A total of 385 MaBC and 68,065 FBC were included. Median time from initiation of NAC to surgery was 143 days in MaBC and 148 days in FBC. Proportions of pCR in MaBC and FBC by TS were: hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HR+/HER2–): 4.9% vs 9.7%, p =.01; HR+/HER2+: 16.1% vs 33.6%, p <.001; HR–/HER2+: 44.0% vs 53.2%, p =.42; and HR–/HER2–: 21.4% vs 32.1%, p =.18, respectively. FBC had twice the odds of pCR than MaBC (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5–2.8; p <.001). Five-year OS for MaBC with pCR vs not was 90% vs 64.7%; p =.02. Five-year OS for FBC with pCR vs not was 91.9% vs 75.3%; p <.01. Conclusions: Proportions and odds of pCR to NAC were numerically lower in MaBC compared with FBC for each TS and statistically significant for HR+/HER2– and HR+/HER2+. The independent association of sex with pCR was confirmed in multivariable analysis. pCR is prognostic in both MaBC and FBC. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease, accounting for <1% of all male carcinomas. Lack of prospective data, the current therapy for MBC is based on retrospective analysis or information that is extrapolated from studies of female patients. We constructed a nomogram model for predicting the overall survival (OS) of MBC patients and verify its feasibility using data from China. Methods: Constructed a predictive model using 1224 MBC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry between 2010 and 2015. The performance of the model was externally validated between 2002 to 2021 using 44 MBC patients from the Fujian Medical University Union Hospital. The independent prognostic factors were selected by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The nomogram was constructed to predict individual survival outcomes for MBC patients. The discriminative power, calibration, and clinical effectiveness of the nomogram were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: A total of 1224 male breast cancer patients were in the training cohort and 44 in the validation cohort. T status (p<0.001), age at diagnosis (p<0.001), histologic grade (p=0.008), M status (p<0.001), ER status (p=0.001), Her2 status (p=0.019), chemotherapy (p=0.015) were independently associated with OS. The diagnostic performance of this model was evaluated and validated using ROC curves on the training and validation datasets. In the training cohort, the nomogram-predicted AUC value was 0.786 for 3-year OS and 0.767 for 5-year OS. In the validation cohort, the nomogram-predicted AUC value was 0.893 for 3-year OS and 0.895 for 5-year OS. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram was more benefit than the AJCC stage. Conclusions: We developed a nomogram that predicts 3-year and 5-year survival in MBC patients. Validation using bootstrap sampling revealed optimal discrimination and calibration, suggesting that the nomogram may have clinical utility. The results remain reproducible in the validation cohort which included Chinese data. The model was superior to the AJCC stage system as shown in the decision curve analysis (DCA).

	abstract = {Introduction: Male breast carcinoma (MBC) is an uncommon disease, accounting for less than 0.5% of cancer diagnoses in men. Data on the prevalence thereof in Argentina are unknown. Primary objective: To estimate the prevalence of a men's health history associated with MBC as well as the anthropometric and clinical characteristics of the study population. Methods: This cross-sectional study included all men according to original biological sex over 18 years of age with a history of breast cancer who sought care at the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires [Italian Hospital of Buenos Aires] between January 2010 and December 2018. Results: We included 57 men with breast cancer. Their median age was 71 years. Of them, 53.06% had obesity and 24.53% had diabetes. With respect to men's health history, 5.56% (2/36) had infertility, 29.17% (14/48) had gynaecomastia and 60.71% (17/28) had sexual dysfunction. Some 63% (7/11) had androgen deficiency based on laboratory diagnosis; of them, 45.45% (5/11) had high gonadotropins. Conclusion: We identified similarities with the literature as to the prevalence of obesity, diabetes and infertility in patients with MBC. The prevalence of testosterone deficiency was higher than reported for men of the same age. Many of these factors support the need to examine the role of endogenous hormones. Further research is required to help physicians care for and counsel men at higher risk of this disease. © 2022 SEEN y SED},

	abstract = {Aim: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and accounts for approximately 1% of breast cancer. Treatment is largely extrapolated from female breast cancer due to lack of data in MBC. However, there are distinct features of MBC that warrant different treatment approach. We aim to better characterize the risk factors, clinicopathologic features, treatment and outcome of MBC patients from six hospitals across Steward Healthcare Network. Materials & methods: A total of 107 men with breast cancer were identified from the respective cancer registry at Steward and 64 patients were included with complete medical records. Their clinical, histopathological and treatment records were retrospectively reviewed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the 5, 10 year overall survival (OS) rate and relapse free survival rate and Cox Regression test was used to assess the association between patient outcome and age at diagnosis, metastasis status at time of diagnosis, tumor size, nodal involvement and use of chemotherapy. Results: Of these 64 patients, median age at diagnosis was 68 years, majority of patients were white, 13 patients had family history of breast or ovarian cancer (20.3%), four patients tested positive for BRCA2 (6.25). Majority of patients presented painless breast lump. A total of 59 patients (92.2%) had invasive ductal carcinoma, and 31 patients (48.4%) had lymph node involvement at time of diagnosis. A total of 62 patients (96.8%) had M0 disease at time of diagnosis. About 97% of patients had estrogen receptor (ER) positive cancer. Most patients underwent mastectomy (87.5%), 35 patients (54.6%) received adjuvant radiation therapy, 19 patients (30%) received adjuvant chemotherapy and 96.7% of patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy. The median follow-up was 71.5 months (range 6-250 months), 5-year survival rate was 86.9% (95% CI: 74.5-93.6%), 5-year relapse free survival rate was 89.9% (95% CI: 77.4-95.7%) and 10-year survival rate was 58.1% (95% CI: 41.0-71.8%). The presence of distant metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis was the only factor associated with shorter OS (hazard ratio: 22.54, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Majority of MBC patients present with palpable breast mass and the tumors are almost exclusively hormone receptor positive. Majority of patients present without distant metastasis and received surgical therapy; however, only a small subset of patients received breast conserving surgery for T1 tumor. Almost all patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy. OS and relapse free survival in our cohort is similar to historic reports in female breast cancer. © 2022 Guoliang Zheng.},

	abstract = {The most common surgical treatment for male breast cancer (MBC) is mastectomy. As breast reconstruction surgery is uncommon, men are thus left without a nipple and areola, with a surgical scar and chest asymmetry. MBC is an understudied field, with little known about how men experience their postsurgical bodies. The present study qualitatively explores the ways Israeli men perceive, feel, and manage their bodies postbreast cancer surgery. It draws on theories of cognitive–behavioral body image, self-discrepancy, and gender role strain theory, and takes into consideration the Israeli sociocultural context of the masculine body. We conducted in-depth interviews with 16 men, ages 25–78 who were diagnosed with MBC about their illness experience. Thematic content analysis explored participants’ postsurgical bodily experience and yielded four themes: (a) A damaged body appearance; (b) Challenging masculinity; (c) Eyes watching: Being under observation by self and others; and (d) Managing body appearance. Findings revealed the prominent place of the postsurgical appearance for men. Specifically, men’s encounter with their operated-on breast and their feeling of being stared at triggered emotional difficulties related to a damaged body image, which was managed using different concealment practices. The sociocultural context of the masculine body is discussed in relation to the discrepancy found between the ideal Israeli masculine body and participants’ perceptions of their actual appearance. The study stresses the negative ramifications of MBC surgery for men, which should be addressed by discussing with them breast reconstruction solutions and/or conservation surgery when possible, and attending to the emotional implications of mastectomy © 2022 American Psychological Association},

Some strategies such as health education disseminating knowledge about MBC can be essential for early discovery and finding better prognosis. Objective: Protocol to map the available evidence of health education approaches on MBC. Methods: A scoping review on health education on MBC will be carried out in Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS), Web of Science, Scopus, Scielo, Online System of Literature Search and Analysis Medical (MEDLINE), Embase, Virtual Health Library (VHL). Two independent reviewers will perform screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment through the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Assessment Checklist. For the quality of evidence, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Analysis will be used. Results: The results of this review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Conclusions: This scoping review will provide evidence of how health education on MBC is being addressed in health systems. Evidence can help healthcare professionals and patients recognize the most effective educational inventions in disseminating knowledge and preventing MBC. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most burdensome cancers worldwide. Despite advancements in diagnostic and treatment modalities, developing countries are still dealing with increasing burdens and existing disparities. This study provides estimates of BC burden and associated risk factors in Iran at the national and subnational levels over 30 years (1990–2019). Methods: Data on BC burden for Iran were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study from 1990 to 2019. GBD estimation methods were applied to explore BC incidence, prevalence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and attributable burden to risk factors based on the GBD risk factors hierarchy. Moreover, decomposition analysis was performed to find the contribution of population growth, aging, and cause-specific incidence in the total incidence change. Age-standardized rates (per 100,000 population) and 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) were reported based on sex, age, and socio-demographic index (SDI). Results: Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) increased from 18.8 (95% UI 15.3–24.1)/100,000 in 2019 to 34.0 (30.7–37.9)/100,000 in 2019 among females and from 0.2/100,000 (0.2–0.3) to 0.3/100,000 (0.3–0.4) among males. Age-standardized deaths rate (ASDR) increased slightly among females from 10.3 (8.2–13.6)/100,000 in 1990 to 11.9 (10.8–13.1)/100,000 in 2019 and remained almost the same among males—0.2/100,000 (0.1–0.2). Age-standardized DALYs rate also increased from 320.2 (265.4–405.4) to 368.7 (336.7–404.3) among females but decreased slightly in males from 4.5 (3.5–5.8) to 4.0 (3.5–4.5). Of the 417.6% increase in total incident cases from 1990–2019, 240.7% was related to cause-specific incidence. In both genders, the BC burden increased by age, including age groups under 50 before routine screening programs, and by SDI levels; the high and high-middle SDI regions had the highest BC burden in Iran. Based on the GBD risk factors hierarchy, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and alcohol were estimated to have the most and the least attributed DALYs for BC among females, respectively. Conclusions: BC burden increased from 1990 to 2019 in both genders, and considerable discrepancies were found among different provinces and SDI quintiles in Iran. These increasing trends appeared to be associated with social and economic developments and changes in demographic factors. Improvements in registry systems and diagnostic capacities were also probably responsible for these growing trends. Raising general awareness and improving screening programs, early detection measures, and equitable access to healthcare systems might be the initial steps to tackle the increasing trends. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Little is known about the experience of the male breast cancer patient. Mastectomy is often offered despite evidence that breast-conserving surgery (BCS) provides similar outcomes. Methods: Two concurrent online surveys were distributed from August to October 2020 via social media to male breast cancer (MBC) patients and by email to American Society of Breast Surgeon members. The MBC patients were asked their opinions about their surgery, and the surgeons were asked to provide surgical recommendations for MBC patients. Results: The survey involved 63 MBC patients with a mean age of 62 years (range, 31–79 years). Five MBC patients (7.9 %) stated that their surgeon recommended BCS, but 54 (85.7 %) of the patients underwent unilateral, and 8 (12.7 %) underwent bilateral mastectomy. Most of the patients (n = 60, 96.8 %) had no reconstruction. One third of the patients (n = 21, 33.3 %) felt somewhat or very uncomfortable with their appearance after surgery. The response rate was 16.5 % for the surgeons. Of the 438 surgeons who answered the survey, 298 (73.3 %) were female, 215 (51.7 %) were fellowship-trained, and 244 (58.9 %) had been practicing for 16 years or longer. More than half of surgeons (n = 259, 59.1 %) routinely offered BCS to eligible men, and 180 (41.3 %) stated they had performed BCS on a man with breast cancer. Whereas 89 (20.8 %) of the surgeons stated that they routinely offer reconstruction to MBC patients, 87 (20.3 %) said they do not offer reconstruction, 96 (22.4 %) said they offer it only if the patient requests it, and 157 (36.6 %) said they never consider it as an option. Conclusions: The study found discordance between MBC patients’ satisfaction with their surgery and surgeon recommendations and experience. These data present an opportunity to optimize the MBC patient experience. © 2022, Society of Surgical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Even though male breast cancer (MBC) risk encompasses both genetic and environmental aetiologies, the primary risk factor is a germline pathogenic variant (PV) or likely pathogenic variant (LPV) in BRCA2, BRCA1 and/or PALB2 genes. To identify new potential MBC-specific predisposition genes, we sequenced a panel of 585 carcinogenesis genes in an MBC cohort without BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 PV/LPV. We identified 14 genes carrying rare PVs/LPVs in the MBC population versus noncancer non-Finnish European men, predominantly coding for DNA repair and maintenance of genomic stability proteins. We identified for the first time PVs/LPVs in PRCC (pre-mRNA processing), HOXA9 (transcription regulation), RECQL4 and WRN (maintenance of genomic stability) as well as in genes involved in other cellular processes. To study the specificity of this MBC PV/LPV profile, we examined whether variants in the same genes could be detected in a female breast cancer (FBC) cohort without BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 PV/LPV. Only 5/109 women (4.6%) carried a PV/LPV versus 18/85 men (21.2%) on these genes. FBC did not carry any PV/LPV on 11 of these genes. Although 5.9% of the MBC cohort carried PVs/LPVs in PALLD and ERCC2, neither of these genes were altered in our FBC cohort. Our data suggest that in addition to BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2, other genes involved in DNA repair/maintenance or genomic stability as well as cell adhesion may form a specific MBC PV/LPV signature. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (mBC) is associated with a high prevalence of pathogenic variants (PVs) in the BRCA2 gene; however, data regarding other BC predisposition genes are limited. In this retrospective multicenter study, we investigated the prevalence of PVs in BRCA1/2 and 23 non- BRCA1/2 genes using a sample of 614 patients with mBC, recruited through the centers of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer. A high proportion of patients with mBC carried PVs in BRCA2 (23.0%, 142/614) and BRCA1 (4.6%, 28/614). The prevalence of BRCA1/2 PVs was 11.0% in patients with mBC without a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Patients with BRCA1/2 PVs did not show an earlier disease onset than those without. The predominant clinical presentation of tumor phenotypes was estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, and HER2-negative (77.7%); further, 10.2% of the tumors were triple-positive, and 1.2% were triple-negative. No association was found between ER/PR/HER2 status and BRCA1/2 PV occurrence. Comparing the prevalence of protein-truncating variants (PTVs) between patients with mBC and control data (ExAC, n = 27,173) revealed significant associations of PTVs in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 with mBC (BRCA1: OR = 17.04, 95% CI = 10.54–26.82, p < 10−5; BRCA2: OR = 77.71, 95% CI = 58.71–102.33, p < 10−5). A case-control investigation of 23 non-BRCA1/2 genes in 340 BRCA1/2-negative patients and ExAC controls revealed significant associations of PTVs in CHEK2, PALB2, and ATM with mBC (CHEK2: OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.59–7.71, p = 0.002; PALB2: OR = 14.77, 95% CI = 5.02–36.02, p < 10−5; ATM: OR = 3.36, 95% CI = 0.89–8.96, p = 0.04). Overall, our findings support the benefit of multi-gene panel testing in patients with mBC irrespective of their family history, age at disease onset, and tumor phenotype. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Objectives: This research was designed to compare the ability of different machine learning (ML) models and nomogram to predict distant metastasis in male breast cancer (MBC) patients and to interpret the optimal ML model by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. Methods: Four powerful ML models were developed using data from male breast cancer (MBC) patients in the SEER database between 2010 and 2015 and MBC patients from our hospital between 2010 and 2020. The area under curve (AUC) and Brier score were used to assess the capacity of different models. The Delong test was applied to compare the performance of the models. Univariable and multivariable analysis were conducted using logistic regression. Results: Of 2351 patients were analyzed; 168 (7.1%) had distant metastasis (M1); 117 (5.0%) had bone metastasis, and 71 (3.0%) had lung metastasis. The median age at diagnosis is 68.0 years old. Most patients did not receive radiotherapy (1723, 73.3%) or chemotherapy (1447, 61.5%). The XGB model was the best ML model for predicting M1 in MBC patients. It showed the largest AUC value in the tenfold cross validation (AUC:0.884; SD:0.02), training (AUC:0.907; 95% CI: 0.899—0.917), testing (AUC:0.827; 95% CI: 0.802—0.857) and external validation (AUC:0.754; 95% CI: 0.739—0.771) sets. It also showed powerful ability in the prediction of bone metastasis (AUC: 0.880, 95% CI: 0.856—0.903 in the training set; AUC: 0.823, 95% CI:0.790—0.848 in the test set; AUC: 0.747, 95% CI: 0.727—0.764 in the external validation set) and lung metastasis (AUC: 0.906, 95% CI: 0.877—0.928 in training set; AUC: 0.859, 95% CI: 0.816—0.891 in the test set; AUC: 0.756, 95% CI: 0.732—0.777 in the external validation set). The AUC value of the XGB model was larger than that of nomogram in the training (0.907 vs 0.802) and external validation (0.754 vs 0.706) sets. Conclusions: The XGB model is a better predictor of distant metastasis among MBC patients than other ML models and nomogram; furthermore, the XGB model is a powerful model for predicting bone and lung metastasis. Combining with SHAP values, it could help doctors intuitively understand the impact of each variable on outcome. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare disease, accounting for less than 1% of all cases of breast cancer. However, the incidence of male breast cancer is increasing. In this study, we systematically analyzed the cases of male breast cancer and evaluated the management of operable male breast cancer in daily clinical practice according to the international clinical guidelines. Data of male breast cancer characteristics and management were recorded from our electronic database. We present a case series of male breast cancer patients treated at our institution between 2013 and 2021 and summarize the recommendations on management of male patients with breast cancer. Twenty-six patients met the search criteria. The majority of tumors were hormone-receptor positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative. Two tumors were derived from axillary accessory breast. All patients underwent mastectomy. Fifteen patients received adjuvant chemotherapy containing anthracycline or taxane. Ten patients received adjuvant radiotherapy for lymph node metastasis. Twenty-five patients received adjuvant endocrine therapy. None of patients received anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 therapy. During the median follow-up period of 37 months, one patient died of previous lung cancer recurrence and one patient developed lung metastases 2 years after breast surgery. No recurrence or distant metastasis occurred in the other twenty-four patients. The incidence of male breast cancer is low. In this study, we present twenty-six cases of male patients with operable breast cancer in our department. All of them received surgery and adjuvant treatment. Early diagnosis and combined therapy benefit male patients with breast cancer. Surgery together with adjuvant treatment can bring a good prognosis. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: The association of weight loss medications with prostate (PCa), colorectal (CRC) or male breast cancers, including assessment of these cancers combined (HRCs, hormone-associated cancers) remain poorly understood. Testosterone replacement therapy (TTh) is reported to be inversely associated with obesity, PCa and CRC, but it is unclear whether TTh modifies the association of weight loss medications with HRCs. Methods: In 49,038 men (≥ 65 years) of SEER-Medicare, we identified 15,471 men diagnosed with PCa, 4836 with CRC, and 141 with male breast cancers. Pre-diagnostic prescription of weight loss medications and TTh was ascertained for this analysis. Weighted multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic and Cox proportional hazards (mortality) models were conducted. Results: We found an inverse association between use of weight loss medications and incident PCa (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.57–0.62), CRC (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80–0.92), and HRCs (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.62–0.68). Similar associations were observed for advanced stage at diagnosis of PCa and CRC. Effects of weight loss medications on PCa and HRC remained significant irrespective of the use of TTh but were only suggestive with CRC with positive TTh use. No associations were observed with male breast cancer and HRCs mortality. Conclusion: Pre-diagnostic use of weight loss medications reduced the incidence of PCa, CRC, and HRCs. These associations persisted in the same direction irrespective of the history of TTh use. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings and to identify underlying biological mechanisms of weight loss medications and TTh on the risk of cancer. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate male breast cancer patients in terms of clinicopathological, treatment parameters, and determine progression-free survival, and the parameters that affect it. Methods: We retrospectively investigated the treatment files of 32 male breast cancer patients diagnosed histopathologically between June 2006 and June 2021. We evaluated clinicopathologic features of the patients and treatment characteristics. The study’s primary endpoint was to determine progression-free survival (PFS) and the statistically significant influencing parameters. PFS analysis was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method, while comparing the effects of parameters, log-rank analysis was used. Results: The median age of the patients was 56 years (33-88). The median tumor size was 2.6 cm (0.6-7). The tumor was HR (hormone receptor) positive HER2 (Human epidermal growth factor receptor) negative in 25 patients (78.1%), HER 2 positive in 6 patients (1.8%). Only one patient (3.1%) was triple negative.The median follow-up time was 26 months (3-121). The median PFS was 22 months, and 2-year PFS was 72%. A statistically significant correlation was found between PFS and tumor size (p 0.042). The 2-year PFS was calculated as 100% in patients with tumor size less than 3 cm and in 55% in patients with tumor size 3 cm and above. Conclusion: In this study the patients were younger compared to Western series. Apart from this, the patients were compatible with the literature in terms of clinicopathological and treatment features. Tumor size (≥3cm) was a prognostic factor affecting PFS. © 2021 Zerbinis Publications. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer in men accounts for fewer than 1 % of all breast cancer cases diagnosed in men and women. Genes which predispose to male breast cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2. The role of other genes is less clear. In Poland, 20 founder mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, NBN, RECQL are responsible for the majority of hereditary breast cancer cases in women, but the utility this genes panel has not been tested in men. Methods: We estimated the prevalence of 20 alleles in six genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, NBN, RECQL) in 165 Polish male breast cancer patients. We compared the frequency of selected variants in male breast cancer cases and controls. Results: One of the 20 mutations was seen in 22 of 165 cases (13.3%). Only one BRCA1 mutation and two BRCA2 mutations were found. We observed statistically significant associations for PALB2 and CHEK2 truncating mutations. A PALB2 mutation was detected in four cases (OR = 11.66; p < 0.001). A CHEK2 truncating mutation was detected in five cases (OR = 2.93;p = 0.02). Conclusion: In conclusion, we recommend that a molecular test for BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and CHEK2 recurrent mutations should be offered to male breast cancer patients in Poland. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: With increasing survival after cancer diagnoses, second primary cancers (SPCs) are becoming more prevalent. We investigated the incidence and site of non-breast SPC risks following male breast cancer (BC). Methods: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were systematically searched for studies reporting standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for SPCs published by March 2022. Meta-analyses used the generic inverse-variance method, assuming a random-effects model. We evaluated SIRs for overall SPCs, site-specific risks, by age at BC onset, time since BC onset and geographic region. We assessed study quality using routine techniques. Results: Eight population-based retrospective cohort studies were identified. SIRs ranged from 1.05 to 2.17. The summary SIR estimate was 1.27 (95% CI: 1.03–1.56, I2: 86%), and there were increased colorectal (SIR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03–1.61), pancreatic (SIR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.05–2.55) and thyroid (SIR: 5.58, 95% CI: 1.04–30.05) SPC risks. When an outlying study was excluded, the summary SIR for men diagnosed with BC before age 50 was 1.50 (95% CI: 1.21–1.85), significantly higher than men diagnosed at older ages (SIR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.98–1.33). Conclusions: Male BC survivors are at elevated risks of developing second primary colorectal, pancreatic and thyroid cancers. The estimates may assist their clinical management and guide decisions on genetic testing. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancer but the incidence has increased worldwide. Risk factors include increased longevity, obesity, testicular diseases and tumours, and germline mutations of BRCA2. BRCA2 carriers have 80 times the risk of the general population. Men generally present with breast cancer at an older age compared with women. Histologically, MBC is often of grade 2, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, and no special type carcinoma although in situ and invasive papillary carcinomas are common. Reporting and staging are similar to female breast cancer. Metastatic lesions to the male breast do occur and should be differentiated from primary carcinomas. Until recently, MBC was thought to be similar to the usual ER positive post-menopausal female counterpart. However, advances in MBC research and trials have highlighted significant differences between the two. This review provides an up to date overview of the biology, genetics, and histology of MBC with comparison to female breast cancers and differential diagnosis from histological mimics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Compared with breast cancer (BC) in women, BC in men is a rare disease with genetic and molecular peculiarities. Therapeutic approaches for male BC (MBC) are currently extrapolated from the clinical management of female BC, although the disease does not exactly overlap in males and females. Data on specific molecular biomarkers in MBC are lacking, cutting out male patients from more appropriate therapeutic strategies. Growing evidence indicates that Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) multigene panel testing can be used for the detection of predictive molecular biomarkers, including Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) and Microsatellite Instability (MSI). Methods: In this study, NGS multigene gene panel sequencing, targeting 1.94 Mb of the genome at 523 cancer-relevant genes (TruSight Oncology 500, Illumina), was used to identify and characterize somatic variants, Copy Number Variations (CNVs), TMB and MSI, in 15 Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) male breast cancer samples. Results and discussion: A total of 40 pathogenic variants were detected in 24 genes. All MBC cases harbored at least one pathogenic variant. PIK3CA was the most frequently mutated gene, with six (40.0%) MBCs harboring targetable PIK3CA alterations. CNVs analysis showed copy number gains in 22 genes. No copy number losses were found. Specifically, 13 (86.7%) MBCs showed gene copy number gains. MYC was the most frequently amplified gene with eight (53.3%) MBCs showing a median fold-changes value of 1.9 (range 1.8-3.8). A median TMB value of 4.3 (range 0.8-12.3) mut/Mb was observed, with two (13%) MBCs showing high-TMB. The median percentage of MSI was 2.4% (range 0-17.6%), with two (13%) MBCs showing high-MSI. Overall, these results indicate that NGS multigene panel sequencing can provide a comprehensive molecular tumor profiling in MBC. The identification of targetable molecular alterations in more than 70% of MBCs suggests that the NGS approach may allow for the selection of MBC patients eligible for precision/targeted therapy.

Materials and Methods: The protein content of four male breast tumors and corresponding adjacent healthy (control) tissues was analyzed by high-throughput nano-liquid chromatography-MS/MS technology. Results: A total of 2,352 proteins were identified, that correspond to 1,249 single gene products, with diverse biological roles. Of those, a panel of 119 differentially expressed tissue proteins was identified in MBC samples compared to controls; 90 were found to be over-expressed in MBC tissues, while 29 were down-regulated. Concurrently, 844 proteins were detected only in MBC tumors and 197 were expressed exclusively in control mammary samples. Conclusion: Differential proteomic expression was found in MBC tissue, leading to improved understanding of MBC pathology and highlighting the need for personalized management of male patients. © 2022 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

The purpose of this study was to analyze clinical and pathological prognostic factors of MBC. METHODS: This is a retrospective study including 32 men diagnosed and treated for a primary breast cancer at the department of medical oncology in Sfax between 2005 and 2020. RESULTS: The incidence of MBC was 1.3%. The median age of our patients was 55 years (range: 29-85 years). The average tumor size of 3.9 cm. Lymph nodes involvement was present in 18 cases (56.2%) with capsular rupture in 52% cases. Tumor was grade II in 71.8 % of cases. The expression of hormonal receptors was founded in 100% of cases. Two patients had an overexpression of HER2 (6.2%). There was no case of triple negative MBC. The OS at 5 and 10 years was 67.8% and 30.8% respectively. Prognostic factors were T4 (p = 0.015), involved nodes (p = 0.035), M+ (p = 0.01), SBR III (p = 0.0001) and HER2+++ (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Contrary to breast cancer in women, our study showed that Tunisian MBC have positive hormone receptors in all cases.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare but aggressive malignancy with cellular and immunological characteristics that remain unclear. Here, we perform transcriptomic analysis for 111,038 single cells from tumor tissues of six MBC and thirteen female breast cancer (FBC) patients. We find that that MBC has significantly lower infiltration of T cells relative to FBC. Metastasis-related programs are more active in cancer cells from MBC. The activated fatty acid metabolism involved with FASN is related to cancer cell metastasis and low immune infiltration of MBC. T cells in MBC show activation of p38 MAPK and lipid oxidation pathways, indicating a dysfunctional state. In contrast, T cells in FBC exhibit higher expression of cytotoxic markers and immune activation pathways mediated by immune-modulatory cytokines. Moreover, we identify the inhibitory interactions between cancer cells and T cells in MBC. Our study provides important information for understanding the tumor immunology and metabolism of MBC. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: 1% of all breast cancer cases occur in men. There are significant differences regarding clinical behaviour and genetic profiles between female (FBC) and male breast cancer (MBC). Parameters for decision-making on treatment and prognosis are derived from FBC. Ki67 has a high value as a prognostic and predictive factor in FBC, but accurate Ki67 cut-off points for MBC are missing. In this study, we aimed to evaluate adequate examination methods and reliable cut-off points for Ki67 to assess the highest prognostic value for patient’s overall survival (OS). Methods: In this multicentric retrospective study, histological specimens were obtained from 104 male patients who were diagnosed and treated for primary invasive breast cancer. We applied three methods of Ki67 analysis: Tumor average scoring (TA), tumor border scoring (TB) and hot-spot scoring (HS). Calculated Ki67 cut-off points for each method were assessed as a threshold for patients’ overall survival (OS). Results: Ki67 cut-off points were 13.5 for the TA group, 22.5 for the HS group and 17.5 for the TB group. Only Ki67 TA cut-off calculations demonstrated statistical significance (p = 0.04). Ki67 expression analysis of TA showed that more than 90% of patients with low Ki67 levels (< 13.5) were alive after 5-year follow-up. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that determination of Ki67 expression in TA is the most reliable to define a cut-off point with high prognostic value. A Ki67 cut-off point of 13.5 shows highest statistical power to define luminal A subgroup and OS. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is mainly considered a disease in women, but male BC (MaBC) accounts for approximately 1.0% of BC diagnoses and 0.5% of malignant neoplasms in the western population. The stigmatization of MaBC, the fact that men are less likely to undergo regular health screenings, and the limited knowledge of health professionals about MaBC contribute to men being diagnosed at more advanced stages. The aim of this article is to increase the visibility of MaBC among urologists, who have more contact with male patients. This review highlights key points about the disease, the risk factors associated with MaBC, and the options for treatment. Obesity and increased population longevity are among the important risk factors for MaBC, but published studies have identified family history as extremely relevant in these patients and associated with a high penetrance at any age. There is currently no screening for MaBC in the general population, but the possibility of screening in men at high risk for developing BC can be considered. The treatment of MaBC is multidisciplinary, and, because of its rarity, there are no robust clinical studies evaluating the role of systemic therapies in the management of both localized and metastatic disease. Therefore, in current clinical practice, treatment strategies for men with breast cancer are extrapolated from information arising from studies in female patients © 2022,International Braz J Urol.All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {AIM: To review outcomes of male patients attending the breast unit, evaluate effectiveness of imaging and examination in detecting breast cancer and review adherence to guidelines for male breast imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of male patients attending Cambridge Breast Unit from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2019. Patient electronic records and imaging were reviewed to establish demographics, clinical findings, imaging, biopsy, and pathology outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1,362 male patients attending the breast unit, 1,028 (75%) had imaging performed. Biopsy was performed in 41 men (3%), with 14 cancers diagnosed (1%). Clinical examination showed 42.7% sensitivity, 99.6% specificity, 54.6% positive predictive value (PPV) and 99.4% negative predictive value (NPV) for detection of cancer. Mammogram demonstrated 84.6% sensitivity, 99.4% specificity, 69.8% PPV, and 99.8% NPV for detection of malignancy. Ultrasound demonstrated 78.6% sensitivity, 98.9% specificity, 73.3% PPV and 99.2% NPV for detection of cancer. Forty-one percent of patients <40 years and 51% < 50 years were imaged, who according to local and Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) guidelines did not require imaging based on age and clinical score. CONCLUSION: Male patients account for a small proportion of referrals to the breast unit but generate significant workload. Imaging protocols, incorporating clinical score and age cut-off at 40 years remains robust for detecting malignancy. Clinician awareness of the imaging protocol, and close liaison with radiologists is essential to minimise additional radiology workload. © 2021},

METHODS: In total, 22 (n=22) healthy male and 28 (n=28) male breast cancer patients without synchronous/metachronous tumors were included in this study. They were grouped as the healthy male control group (Group 1) and the male breast cancer patient group (Group 2). The male breast cancer was divided into two subgroups, namely, early stage [(stage: 0/I/II) (Group 2A)] and late stage [(stage: III/IV) (Group 2B)], and their hemogram index parameters were compared. RESULTS: A significant (p>0.05) increase was observed in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and·platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values in the late stage (Group 2B: stage III/IV) compared to the early stage (Group 2A: stage 0/I/II) and healthy control (Group 1) groups. CONCLUSIONS: In male breast cancer patients, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and platelet/lymphocyte ratio values were significantly higher as the stage of cancer increased.

	abstract = {Background: Germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in BRCA1/2 genes are associated with breast cancer (BC) risk in both women and men. Multigene panel testing is being increasingly used for BC risk assessment, allowing the identification of PVs in genes other than BRCA1/2. While data on actionable PVs in other cancer susceptibility genes are now available in female BC, reliable data are still lacking in male BC (MBC). This study aimed to provide the patterns, prevalence and risk estimates associated with PVs in non-BRCA1/2 genes for MBC in order to improve BC prevention for male patients. Methods: We performed a large case-control study in the Italian population, including 767 BRCA1/2-negative MBCs and 1349 male controls, all screened using a custom 50 cancer gene panel. Results: PVs in genes other than BRCA1/2 were significantly more frequent in MBCs compared with controls (4.8% vs 1.8%, respectively) and associated with a threefold increased MBC risk (OR: 3.48, 95% CI: 1.88–6.44; p < 0.0001). PV carriers were more likely to have personal (p = 0.03) and family (p = 0.02) history of cancers, not limited to BC. PALB2 PVs were associated with a sevenfold increased MBC risk (OR: 7.28, 95% CI: 1.17–45.52; p = 0.034), and ATM PVs with a fivefold increased MBC risk (OR: 4.79, 95% CI: 1.12–20.56; p = 0.035). Conclusions: This study highlights the role of PALB2 and ATM PVs in MBC susceptibility and provides risk estimates at population level. These data may help in the implementation of multigene panel testing in MBC patients and inform gender-specific BC risk management and decision making for patients and their families. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Since breast cancer is less common in men than in women, data on the use of new therapeutic agents, including cyclin-dependent kinase 4–6 (CDK 4–6) inhibitors, are limited in patients with metastatic hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) male breast cancer. Therefore; we aimed to investigate the treatment responses of metastatic HR+, HER2-male breast cancer patients treated with CDK 4–6 inhibitors in a multicenter real-life cohort. Methods: Male patients with a diagnosis of HR+ and HER2-metastatic breast cancer, treated with any CDK 4–6 inhibitor, were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded. We aimed to determine progression-free survival (PFS) time, response rates and drug related side effects. Results: A total 25 patients from 14 institutions were recruited. The mean age at diagnosis was 57 years. Median follow-up was 19.53 (95% CI: 14.04–25.02) months. The overall response rate was 60%. While the median PFS was 20.6 months in the whole cohort, it wasn't reached in those using CDK 4–6 inhibitors in first line and 10 months in the subsequent lines (p:0.009). No new adverse events were encountered. Conclusion: In our study, we found that CDK 4–6 inhibitors are effective and safe options in men with HR+ and HER2-metastatic breast cancer as in women. Our results support the use of CDK 4–6 inhibitor-based combinations in the first-line treatment of HR+ and HER2-metastatic male breast cancer. © 2022},

Despite recognized clinico-pathological and molecular differences to female breast cancer (FBC), the clinical management of MBC follows established FBC treatment strategies. Loss of function mutations in the DNA damage response genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of MBC. While there have been extensive clinical advancements in other BRCA-related malignancies, including FBC, improvements in MBC remain stagnant. Here we present a review that highlights the lack of treatment evidence for BRCA-related MBC and the required national and global collaborative effort to address this unmet need. In doing so, we summarize the transformative clinical advancements with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in other BRCA-related cancers namely, FBC and prostate cancer. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (BCa) is a rare disease accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancers and 1% of all cancers in males. The clinical management is largely extrapolated from female BCa. Several multigene assays are increasingly used to guide clinical treatment decisions in female BCa, however, there are limited data on the utility of these tests in male BCa. Here we present the gene expression results of 381 M0, ER+ve, HER2-ve male BCa patients enrolled in the Part 1 (retrospective analysis) of the International Male Breast Cancer Program. Using a custom NanoString™ panel comprised of the genes from the commercial risk tests Prosigna®, OncotypeDX®, and MammaPrint®, risk scores and intrinsic subtyping data were generated to recapitulate the commercial tests as described by us previously. We also examined the prognostic value of other risk scores such as the Genomic Grade Index (GGI), IHC4-mRNA and our prognostic 95-gene signature. In this sample set of male BCa, we demonstrated prognostic utility on univariate analysis. Across all signatures, patients whose samples were identified as low-risk experienced better outcomes than intermediate-risk, with those classed as high risk experiencing the poorest outcomes. As seen with female BCa, the concordance between tests was poor, with C-index values ranging from 40.3% to 78.2% and Kappa values ranging from 0.17 to 0.58. To our knowledge, this is the largest study of male breast cancers assayed to generate risk scores of the current commercial and academic risk tests demonstrating comparable clinical utility to female BCa. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background. Mammography is a method widely used for the diagnosis of breast disorders in women and may help detect breast cancer in its early stages. Male breast cancer often remains undiagnosed or is poorly controlled until serious complications arise; therefore, the use of screening methods is needed to help with early diagnosis. Methods. From a total of 1,667 registered mammography cases screened, 17 male breast disease cases were included in this study. Mammography and ultrasound data were analyzed by Statistical Package of Social Sciences v.22 (SPSS). Diagnosis was made following biopsy in suspicious cases, and histopathological and immunological findings of all such patients were obtained for final diagnosis. Results. The mean age of the patients was 35 years (range, 14-70 years); 17.6% of the cases were aged 37 yrs, and 2 cases were aged 51 and 52 yrs. Of the 17 cases, 11 had breast lesions, and skin thickening was observed in only 1 case. The different patterns of lesions detected were asymmetry of the parenchyma, mastitis, and hamartoma (n=1 each), malignant lesions (n=2), and gynecomastia (n=6). According to the BI-RADS categorization, 8 cases were benign, one case was probably benign, and 2 cases were likely malignant. In the 2 cases with malignant lesions, pathological diagnosis was made after hematoxylin and eosin and immunocytochemistry examination as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of no special type (NST), grade II and grade III. Conclusions. Most breast lesions in this study population were benign, while IDC was the most common malignancy encountered. Mammography is currently the most accurate and cost-effective method for detecting breast lesions. The findings of our study may help increase awareness of male breast cancer and encourage Saudi men at risk to perform self-breast exam and undergo routine breast screening.  © 2022 Muhammad Saeed et al.},

We conducted this study to find a reliable prognostic model for advanced male breast cancer. The cohort was selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The enrolled patients were randomly divided into training and validation group. The univariate and multivariate analyses were used for prognostic assessment and a nomogram was built. Calibration curves and concordance index were compiled to determine predictive and discriminatory capacity. The time-dependent receiver operating curves and the decision curve analysis was used to verify the model's ability. Two hundred and eighty individuals were enrolled. The cumulative rates of 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 98.6%, 72% and 57.9%. The C-indexes for OS were 0.835 (95%CI, 0.777–0.893) in the training group and 0.765 (95%CI, 0.668–0.862) in the validation group. The calibration curves confirmed the consistency of the nomogram both in the training and validation group. The time-dependent receiver operating curves and decision curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram had better prediction capacity than TNM stage system for advanced male breast cancer.

The data of 137 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical, histopathological data and ABO/Rh blood groups of the patients were recorded. The ABO/Rh blood group distributions were compared to the healthy men control group (n = 120,160) by the chi-square test. Overall distributions of ABO blood groups were different between the patients (17.5% AB, 38% A, 19% B, and 25.5% O) and control group (7.88% AB, 42.06% A, 15.22% B, and 34.84% O) (P<.001). There were significant differences between the patients and control group with respect to AB vs non-AB blood group distributions (P<.001, odds ratio: 2.43, 95% CI) and O vs non-O blood group distributions (P=.016, odds ratio: 0.62, 95% CI). However, A vs non-A and B vs non-B blood group distributions were not significantly different. The distribution of the Rh factor was similar between patients and the control group (P=.93). In univariate analysis, ABO/Rh blood groups were not a prognostic factor on OS (P=.29). The frequency of the AB blood group in MBC patients is increased than in the healthy control group. AB blood group may be a risk factor for MBC, whereas O blood group may be a protective factor. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, which has restricted prospective research among MBC patients. With effective treatments, the prognosis of MBC patients has improved and developing a second primary malignancy (SPM) has become a life-threatening event for MBC survivors. However, few studies have focused on the prognosis of MBC patients and looked into the SPM issue in MBC survivors. Method: We reviewed MBC patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2016 from the latest Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Plus database. Competing risk models and nomograms were conducted for predicting the risk of cancer-specific death and SPM occurrence. C-indexes, calibration curves, ROC curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curves were applied for validation. Result: A total of 1,843 MBC patients with complete information were finally enrolled and 60 (3.26%) had developed an SPM. Prostate cancer (40%) was the most common SPM. The median OS of all the enrolled patients was 102.41 months, while the median latency from the initial MBC diagnosis to the subsequent diagnosis of SPM was 67.2 months. The patients who suffered from an SPM shared a longer OS than those patients with only one MBC (p = 0.027). The patients were randomly divided into the development cohort and the validation cohort (at a ratio of 7:3). The Fine and Gray competing risk model was used to identify the risk factors. Two nomograms were constructed and validated to predict the 5-year, 8-year, and 10-year survival probability of MBC patients, both of which had good performance in the C-index, ROC curves, calibration plots, and DCA curves, showing the ideal discrimination capability and predictive value clinically. Furthermore, we, for the first time, constructed a nomogram based on the competing risk model to predict the 5-year, 8-year, and 10-year probability of developing an SPM in MBC survivors, which also showed good discrimination, calibration, and clinical effectiveness. Conclusion: We, for the first time, included treatment information and clinical parameters to construct a nomogram to predict not only the survival probability of MBC patients but also the probability of developing an SPM in MBC survivors, which were helpful in individual risk estimation, patient follow-up, and counseling in MBC patients.

	abstract = {Purpose: To identify the practice patterns related to use of surveillance mammography in male breast cancer (MaBC) survivors. Methods: Using administrative claims data from OptumLabs Data Warehouse, we identified men who underwent surgery for breast cancer during 2007–2017. We calculated the proportion of men who had at least one mammogram (a) within 13 months for all patients and (b) within 24 months amongst those who maintained their insurance coverage for at least that length of time after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify factors associated with mammography within each timeframe. Results: Out of 729 total MaBC survivors, 209 (29%) underwent mammography within 13 months after surgery. Among those who had lumpectomy, 41% underwent mammography, whereas among those who had mastectomy, 27% had mammography. Amongst 526 men who maintained consistent insurance coverage for 24 months after surgery, 215 (41%) underwent mammography at least once during that 24-month period. In this cohort, the proportion who had at least one mammogram during the 24-month period was 49% after lumpectomy and 40% after mastectomy. In a multivariate logistic regression model, more recent diagnosis (2015+) and older age at diagnosis were associated with lower odds of undergoing mammography, while receipt of radiation was associated with higher odds of undergoing mammography. Conclusions: Although recent ASCO guidelines recommend surveillance mammography after lumpectomy, a minority of MaBC survivors undergo surveillance mammography, even after lumpectomy. This is likely due to the paucity of data regarding the true benefits and harms of surveillance/screening mammography for MaBC. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite evidence that early-stage male breast cancer (MBC) can be treated the same as in females, we hypothesized that men undergo more extensive surgery. Methods: Patients with clinical T1-2 breast cancer were identified in the National Cancer Database 2004–2016. Trends in surgery type and overall survival were compared between sexes. Results: Of 9,782 males and 1,078,105 females, most were cN0 with AJCC stage I/II disease. Unilateral mastectomy was most common in men (67.1% vs. 24.1%, p < 0.001) and partial mastectomy in women (64.7% vs. 26.4%, p < 0.001), with no significant change over time. Over 1/3 of men received ALND in 2016. While overall survival was superior in females (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73–0.94, p = 0.003), partial mastectomy was associated with a 42% reduction in mortality risk for males (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.4–0.8, p = 0.003). Conclusions: De-escalation of surgery could be considered for MBC to improve survival and align with current standards of care. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, representing <1% of all breast cancers. Treatment recommendations have been extrapolated from trial data of female breast cancer patients. This study aims to report our institutional experience of MBC across a 20 year period, analyse the survival outcome and prognosis of this group against female breast cancer patients treated at the same centre. Methods: Clinical, histopathological, treatment and survival data of male and female breast cancer patients treated between Jan 1999 and July 2019 at Singapore General Hospital and National Cancer Centre Singapore were identified and analysed. Results: Fifty-seven male patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 63 years. Majority had invasive ductal carcinoma (86%) and presented at an early disease stage: 70.2% presented as Tis/T1/T2 and 49.1% had no axillary nodal involvement. 84.2% had a simple mastectomy with either a sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary clearance. The median follow up was 5.69 years for males and 5.83 years for females. The median survival was 11.86 years for males and 16.3 years for females. At 5 years, overall survival (OS) was 69.9% (52.3–82.1%) and disease free survival (DFS) was 62.9% (44.9–76.5%) for males compared with OS 83.8% (83.21–84.39%) and DFS 74.5% (73.91–75.09%) for females. Conclusion: MBC remains understudied. Our institutional data indicates that good long term survival in South-East Asian patients can be achieved with treatment protocols that are similar to female breast cancer. More prospective studies are required. © 2022 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.},

	abstract = {Purpose The treatment of male breast cancer (MBC) has been extrapolated from female breast cancer (FBC) because of its rarity despite their different clinicopathologic characteristics. We aimed to investigate the distribution of intrinsic subtypes based on immunohistochemistry, their clinical impact, and treatment pattern in clinical practice through a multicenter study in Korea. Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 248 MBC patients from 18 institutions across the country from January 1995 to July 2016. Results The median age of MBC patients was 63 years (range, 25 to 102 years). Among 148 intrinsic subtype classified patients, 61 (41.2%), 44 (29.7%), 29 (19.5%), and 14 (9.5%) were luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively. Luminal A subtype showed trends for superior survival compared to other subtypes. Most hormone receptor-positive patients (166 patients, 82.6%) received adjuvant endocrine treatment. Five-year completion of adjuvant endocrine treatment was associated with superior disease-free survival (DFS) in patients classified with an intrinsic subtype (hazard ratio [HR], 0.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04 to 0.49; p=0.002) and in all patients (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.54; p=0.003). Conclusion Distribution of subtypes of MBC was similar to FBC and luminal type A was most common. Overall survival tended to be improved for luminal A subtype, although there was no statistical significance. Completion of adjuvant endocrine treatment was associated with prolonged DFS in intrinsic subtype classified patients. MBC patients tended to receive less treatment. MBC patients should receive standard treatment according to guidelines as FBC patients. Copyright © 2023 by the Korean Cancer Association.},

	abstract = {This study was to investigate the prevalence and death risk of male breast cancer (MBC) patients. The prevalence trend was based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1975 to 2017. A competitive risk analysis was performed to analyze the death risk of MBC patients. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The results indicated that the prevalence of MBC after the standardization of the total population increased in 1975–2017 and its annual percentage change (APC) was 0.536% (95% CI = [0.362%, 0.713%]). The prevalence of MBC was rapidly increased in patients aged ≥70 years (APC = 0.780%; 95% CI = [0.491%, 1.076%]) and Grade Ⅱ tumors (APC = 1.462%; 95% CI = [1.260%, 1.686%]). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year cumulative mortality of MBC patients who died of MBC was 2.23% (95% CI = [1.61%, 2.85%]), 7.56% (95% CI = [6.33%, 8.78%]), and 13.10% (95% CI = [11.10%, 11.32%]), respectively. Competitive risk analysis demonstrated that Blacks (HR = 1.76; 95% CI = [1.12, 2.77]), Grade 3 (HR = 2.56; 95% CI = [1.03, 6.35]), AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) Stage Ⅲ (HR = 3.04; 95% CI = [1.76, 5.26]), and AJCC Stage Ⅳ (HR = 7.27; 95% CI = [1.36, 38.83]) were associated with an increased MBC-specific death risk, whereas married status (HR = 0.40; 95% CI = [0.25, 0.64]), surgery (HR = 0.25; 95% CI = [0.12, 0.50]), Luminal A subtype (HR = 0.20; 95% CI = [0.07, 0.53]), and Luminal B subtype (HR = 0.29; 95% CI = [0.10, 0.87]) were related to a reduced MBC-specific death risk. In addition, similar results can be observed in patients with surgery recommended and done (p <.05). This study may provide evidence for the prevalence trend, cumulative mortality, and death risk of MBC patients. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Breast cancer (BC) has been extensively and deeply studied as the number one malignant tumor in women, but its status in male patients, especially in male metastatic patients, is rarely reported. Thus, this study aimed to explore the prognosis and risk factors of male BC with bone metastasis. Patients and Methods: We searched the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to identify all patients diagnosed with male BC with bone metastasis from 2010 to 2016. Risk factors of overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were analyzed by univariable and multivariable Cox analyses. We also drew Kaplan–Meier plots to show the correlation between independent risk factors and survival. Results: A total of 207 male BC patients with bone metastasis were included for analysis. Approximately one-third of patients also had lung metastasis. Luminal A subtype comprised 58.5% of the overall patient population. These patients had a poor prognosis, with 3-year OS and CSS rates, 36.7% and 39.5%, respectively. Further analysis revealed that age ≤60 years old, luminal A or B, and surgery were independent predictors of prolonged OS and CSS. On Cox multivariable analysis, brain metastasis was associated with OS and not CSS. Conclusion: We identified four independent factors associated with prognosis in male BC patients with bone metastasis, namely age, tumor subtype, surgery, and brain metastasis. Knowing these risk factors will help clinicians make more appropriate treatment plans. Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Zhang, Wang and Cao.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer in men is rare and often overlooked as there is a misconception that it is a gendered disease that affects women only. The feminization, or "pinkification,"of the disease has been socially constructed to raise awareness, improve screening, and empower women but has not addressed the occurrence of the illness in men. Men may therefore experience unique psychosocial difficulties when faced with a disease that predominantly affects women, including feelings of disbelief and embarrassment that impact their sense of self and challenge their masculinity. The lack of mammographic screening in men, lack of public awareness, and the shame that develops during the time of diagnosis can result in treatment avoidant behaviors, a delayed presentation, and worse prognosis in men. Although male breast cancer (MBC) is uncommon, the incidence is increasing; therefore, efforts should be made to enhance education for health care professionals and the general public in order to lessen the stigma, with the goal of improving outcomes. Furthermore, special attention to the unique medical needs and hurdles encountered by transgender males can break down health care barriers in this marginalized patient population. This article offers male perceptions on breast cancer, the psychosocial implications of being diagnosed with a gendered disease, and suggestions on how to improve the MBC experience. © 2023 Society of Breast Imaging.

	abstract = {Objectives: The concept of defense mechanisms has undergone extensive revision and expansion since Freud first described these processes. Initially formulated as an unconscious repression of unpleasant memories, with further development focusing on the role of defense mechanisms in the regulation of internal conflicts, the concept shifted and evolved to incorporate the adaptation to external demands, including intrapsychic and interpersonal handling of burden of illness. In addition to defense mechanisms, coping provides another perspective on human adjustment to difficult life events. While there is substantial research on both coping and defense mechanisms in various psychiatric and somatic diseases, including cancer, little is known about defensive regulation, coping, and their interaction in male breast cancer patients. Methods: The present study is part of the N-Male project conducted between 2016 and 2018 in Germany (Male breast cancer: patients' needs in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and follow-up care). Semi-standardized interviews with 27 male breast cancer patients were analyzed with regard to defense mechanisms. In addition, fear of progression and repressive coping was assessed by self-report. Results: There was considerable variety in levels of defensive functioning as well as repressive coping in our sample. We found no difference in overall levels of defensive functioning between men with vs. without repressive coping. However, patients with repressive coping demonstrated a decopupled association between fear of progression and defensive functioning as compared to patients without repressive coping. Discussion: The study provides the first evidence of disease processing in male breast cancer patients Knowledge of patients' defense patterns and repressive coping seems promising for better planning targeted intervention strategies.

	abstract = {Background/Aim: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a very rare disorder affecting approximately 1 in 833 men. Genetic predisposition is one of the most important risk factors of MBC with BRCA2 being the most commonly mutated gene in males diagnosed with breast cancer. However, a large part of MBC heritability is still unexplained. This study sought to add to the data already available on the genetics of MBC. Materials and Methods: Our study initially involved comprehensive analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2, followed by analysis of 43 genes implicated in cancer predisposition in a series of 100 Greek patients diagnosed with MBC between 1995-2015. Results: Pathogenic variants were identified in 13 patients, with BRCA2 being the most commonly affected gene, followed by BRCA1, RAD50, RAD51B, and MSH3. Conclusion: In agreement with previous reports, BRCA2 is the most important genetic factor of MBC predisposition, while the remaining known cancer predisposition genes are each very rarely involved, rendering conclusions as to their cumulative effect difficult to draw. © 2022 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

	abstract = {Incidence of male breast carcinoma (MBC), although rare, recently has an increasing trend. The increase in incidence is associated with increasing age, and poor clinical outcome seen with MBC is mostly because of illiteracy and lack of health education and shyness in reporting to the clinical physician. In this context, a comprehensive review regarding this forth bursting clinical scenario is important. The present article focus on that aspect encompassing but not limited to different clinical studies. The randomized trials on MBC are sparse and most of the studies are retrospective in nature due to rarity of cases. MBC treatment line is derived from female breast cancer guidelines. MBC has a poorer prognosis than female breast cancer. MBC patients in India present in advanced stage and surgery remains challenging due to paucity of breast tissue. Post mastectomy radiation is indicated on the same lines as of female breast cancer and it decreases locoregional recurrence. Adjuvant hormonal therapy decreases recurrence and improves survival. Further clinical trials are required including large number of patients to study different parameters in respect of prognosis and survival.

This common practice may be especially detrimental to trials of rare cancers, such as male breast cancer, that struggle to accrue adequate numbers of participants. Objectives: To estimate prevalence of prior cancer among men newly diagnosed with breast cancer and describe characteristics of men with prior cancer compared to those without. Methods: We identified men diagnosed with breast cancer between 2011-2015 using population-based data from National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of cancer registries. We used sequence number and diagnosis year to identify cancers diagnosed prior to breast cancer (inclusive of prior breast, different, and unknown types of cancer). We compared sociodemographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics of men with and without prior cancer using chi-square tests. Results: Among 2317 men, nearly one quarter (24.3%) had any prior cancer, and the majority (58.7%) of these were of a different cancer type. A higher proportion of men with a prior cancer of a different type were older, had smaller (≤ 2 cm) breast tumors, were diagnosed with stage 0-1 breast cancer, and did not receive surgery compared to men without any prior cancer; there were no statistically significant differences by race and ethnicity, county median income, hormone receptor status, or surgery type. Conclusion: Given prevalence of prior cancer in this rare and understudied population of men diagnosed with breast cancer, including men with prior cancer in clinical trials may improve accrual.  © The author(s).},

The average ages of first-diagnosis MBC patients in JPH and East Asian patients were 59.7 and 62.3 years old, respectively, which were younger than those of SEER patients (66.5 years old). Between East Asian and SEER patients, the status or rates of main breast cancer type, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, breast subtype, and TNM stage were relatively close, and their differences were not statistically significant (P >.05). Differences were observed in chemotherapy, surgery, pathological grade, and lymph node positivity (P <.01). Furthermore, no statistically significant difference was observed between the JPH and East Asian patients (all P >.05). In JPH and SEER, linear regression relationships were observed between the lymph node positivity rate, tumor size, and histological grade.

The purpose of this study was to determine if race/ethnicity is associated with survival among men with breast cancer when stratifying analyses by level of comorbidity. Methods: We used the California Cancer Registry to identify 1730 cases of men and 259,828 cases of women with breast cancer and documented Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Kaplan–Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were used to compare breast cancer–specific survival and risk of mortality for African American/Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander men with White women and White men. Results: When compared with White women, Black men with a CCI of 0 (hazard ratio [HR], 3.09; 95% CI, 1.10–1.16) and a CCI of 2+, (HR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.42–4.42) had an increased risk of mortality when compared with White women. When compared with White men, African American men with a CCI of 0 (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.45–3.85) and 2+ (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.26–4.74) had an increased unadjusted risk of mortality, but these disparities were neutralized when controlling for sociodemographic and clinical factors. Conclusions: Black men with both low and high levels of concomitant disease have an increased risk of mortality when compared with both White men and women, but demographic and clinical factors are contributors to this disparity. © 2023 American Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MaBC) is a rare clinical entity, which makes up approximately 1% of all breast cancers. However, the incidence of MaBC has been steadily increasing over the past few decades. The risk factors for MaBC include age, black race, family history of breast cancer, genetic mutations, liver cirrhosis, and testicular abnormalities. The majority of patients with MaBC present with painless lumps, and about half of the patients have at least one lymph node involved at the time of diagnosis. The treatment of MaBC models that of female breast cancer (FeBC), but this is mainly due to lack of prospective studies for MaBC patients. The treatment modality includes surgery, adjuvant radiation, endocrine therapy, and chemotherapy. However, there are some distinct features of MaBC, both clinically and molecularly, that may warrant a different clinical approach. Ongoing multinational effort is required, to conduct clinical trials for MaBC, or the inclusion of MaBC patients in FeBC trials, to help clinicians improve care for MaBC patients.  © 2022 Guoliang Zheng and Jose Pablo Leone.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, cancer is a huge public health challenge that needs for more advanced researches. Quality of life of patients with breast cancer is an important outcome. Data analyses are usually referred to female breast cancer studies and limited informations are available about male breast cancer. Our study is the first in our country to assess quality of life (QoL) in male patients affected by breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to investigate HRqol (health related quality of life) in male patients with breast cancer and clinico-pathological features at the university hospital of Casablanca, Morocco over a period of 6 years. This study involved 21 male subjects from 2012 to 2018. Required information were collected from the medical records of patients in the oncological center. We included demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics. HRqol was investigated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-Item QoL Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), version 3.0. Mean age of patients at enrollment was 67.3 years (SD=15.6, range=36-87 years), the average consultation delay was 17,7 months, the most common histologic finding was infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma (20 patients, 95.3%). Progesterone and estrogen receptors were positives in 90.4% (19 patients) of cases, the most representative stage was stage III, the most common molecular phenotype was Luminal B (16 patients, 76.2%), modified radical mastectomy was the main surgical procedure. Adjuvant therapy was based on chemotherapy (100%), radiotherapy (76.2%), hormone therapy (90.5%). Ten patients (47.6%) had metastasis. A moderate overall quality of life was reported, with a mean of 50±21.73. The results showed a mean physical function score (54.60±27.85), positive emotional functioning (56.34±31.94) and good social functioning (75.39±17.96). In brief, regarding QOL in this population, it appears to be better than expected andQOL generally improves after treatment. As for prevention, public education should be oriented toward men at higher risk in order to reduce the time between onset of symptoms and consultation. © Majdouline El Fouhi et al.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare. Due to limited information, MBC has always been understudied. We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The clinical and biological features of female breast cancer (FBC) patients were compared with MBC patients. Cox regression models and competing risks analyses were used to identify risk factors associated with cancer-related survival in MBC and FBC groups. Results showed that MBC patients suffered from higher TNM stages, tumor grades, and a higher percentage of hormone receptor-positive tumors, compared with FBC patients (all p < 0.05). In addition, the breast tumor locations varied a lot between males and females (p < 0.05). FBC patients were associated with superior overall survival than MBC patients. Results from multivariate cox regression and competing risks analyses showed age, race, T, N, M-stages, tumor grades, estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) overexpression were independent prognosis factors in FBC patients (all p < 0.05). MBC patients had similar risk factors to FBC patients, but PR and HER-2 status did not independently influence survival (all p > 0.05). Tumor location was an independent prognostic factor for both gender groups. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is one of the rare malignancies that account for less than 1% of all malignancies in males. However, the clinicopathological characteristics of MBC are not entirely similar to female breast cancer; but still, it is treated in line with the female breast cancer protocols. Aims: To retrospectively analyse trends in MBC as to its distribution, presentation, treatment, and outcome. Material and method: A total of 106 patients with MBC from 1991 to 2020 were analysed retrospectively. Frequency distribution analysis of the demographic and clinicopathological data and treatment variables was done. Results: Median age of presentation was 57 years; ranging from 30 to 86 years. Either of the sides was almost equally affected with an R: L ratio of 1.2:1. The average duration of complaint was 26.2 months (range 1–240 months). History of gynaecomastia was noted in 18 patients, significant benign prostate hypertrophy in 13, and hypertension needing medical treatment in 14 patients. The majority of the patients were smokers (72/106) and alcoholics (43/106). Five patients reported positive family history. 21 patients had metastatic disease at presentation and received palliative treatment. Stage II was seen in 36.8%, stage III in 43.4%, and stage IV in 19.8% of patients. Node positives were 63.2%. Pathology was invariably (90.5%) infiltrative ductal carcinoma. Radiation was administered in 85.8% of the patients, chemotherapy in 72.6% of patients, and hormonal treatment was given in 47.2% of patients. The median overall survival (OS) was 78 months. OS at 5 and 10 years was 78% and 58% respectively. Conclusion: Despite the possibility of MBC being apparent at an early stage, patients present with locally advanced disease. Radical surgery with adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy remains the gold standard. Cancer education campaigns must be run to catch the early disease and to radically treat the disease. © 2023 ecancer Global Foundation. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer is a considerably rare condition and only accounts for 1% of all breast cancer cases. Due to limited public awareness, the condition is likely to present late, leading to late diagnosis and treatment worsening morbidity and mortality. This article aims to identify the focus and most influential research on male breast cancer. Objective Identify the most influential papers in male breast cancer. METHODS: Search on Web of Science using the search terms 'Male', 'Breast Cancer' and 'Male breast cancer' to identify all full manuscripts in English language and were ranked by the total number of citations. The top 100 articles were then further analysed according to subject, author, journal, year and country of publications. RESULTS: The mean number of citations per paper was 96. Most cited paper was by Thorlacius, S et al. evaluating the relationship between BRCA2 and female breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer. Cancer is the journal with the most published papers and received most citations in the male breast cancer research field. The USA contributed 49 of the manuscripts in the top 100. The most studied topic was risk factors for male breast cancer, with 20 articles. CONCLUSIONS: The most cited papers identified in this study described the advance in the knowledge of genetics and epidemiology in male breast cancer and has led to improvements in the 4 management of the disease. Most of the highly cited articles in this field were published in high impact journals and had accumulated at least 100 citations to date, reflecting their quality and impact. By collating the most influential publications in this field, this analysis can serve to identify knowledge gaps in male breast cancer research as well as to help identify what makes a paper impactful and citable.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

	abstract = {Background: Although male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease, accounting for <1% of all breast cancers, it has significant oncological, survival and psychosocial implications for patients. The aim of this study is to assess the latest literature in the diagnosis, management, oncological outcomes, and psychosocial impact of MBC. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al., 2009) [1] to explore the management of MBC, with particular focus on investigative imaging, surgical management, oncological outcomes, survival, genetic screening and psychosocial effects. Electronic databases were searched for randomised control trials, cohort studies and case series involving more than 10 patients. Imaging and surgical techniques, local and distant disease recurrence, survival, genetic screening and psychosocial implications in the setting of MBC were assessed. Results: The search criteria identified 199 articles, of which 59 met the inclusion criteria. This included 39,529 patients, with a mean age of 64.5 years (55–71), and a mean follow-up of 66.3 months (26.2–115). Mastectomy remains the most frequently used surgical technique, with an average of 89.6%. Loco-regional and distant recurrence rate was 10.1% and 21.4% respectively. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 and 10 years was 66.8% and 54.5% respectively. Disease-specific survival (DSS) at 5 and 10 years was 87.1% and 67.1% respectively. Overall survival (OS) at 5 and 10 years was 72.7% and 50.7% respectively. Genetic screening was conducted in 38.6% of patients of which 4.8% and 15.8% were found to be BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers respectively. Psychosocial studies were conducted mainly using questionnaire and interview-based methodology focusing primarily on awareness of breast cancer in men, support available and impact on gender identity. Conclusions: This review demonstrates that men present with later stage disease with subsequent impact on survival outcomes. There remains a paucity of high-level evidence and prospective studies are required. There is a need for increasing awareness amongst the public and health care professionals in order to improve outcomes and reduce stigma associated with MBC. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology},

	abstract = {Background In the last years, some studies on the usefulness of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) for the evaluation of male breast cancer (MBC) have been produced. The aim of this review is to analyze the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/CT and its diagnostic performances for the assessment of MBC. Methods A wide literature search of the PubMed/ MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase and Cochrane library databases was made to find relevant published articles on the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT for the evaluation of MBC. Moreover, quality assessment including the risk of bias and applicability concerns was carried out using QUADAS-2 evaluation. Results The comprehensive computer literature search revealed 3178 articles. On reviewing the titles and abstracts, 3170 articles were excluded because the reported data were not within the field of interest and finally eight studies were included in the review, for a total of 176 male patients. The studies considered revealed high diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT for the evaluation of MBC both at staging and restaging of disease. Moreover, its added values compared to conventional imaging are starting to emerge and insight into its controversial prognostic importance is growing. Conclusion Despite some limitations affecting our review, 18F-FDG PET/CT seems to be a valuable tool to assess MBC. Further research studies are required to better underline the role of hybrid imaging with 18F-FDG for the evaluation of MBC, especially in comparison with female breast cancer.

	abstract = {MBC is a rare disease accounting for almost 1% of all cancers in men and less than 1% of breast cancer. Emerging data on the genetic drivers of predisposition for MBC are available and different risk factors have been associated with its pathogenesis. Genetic alterations, such as pathogenetic variants in BRCA1/2 and other moderate-/low-penetrance genes, along with non-genetic risk factors, have been recognized as pathogenic factors for MBC. Preventive and therapeutic implications could be related to the detection of alterations in predisposing genes, especially BRCA1/2, and to the identification of oncogenic drivers different from FBC. However, approved treatments for MBC remain the same as FBC. Cancer genetic counseling has to be considered in the diagnostic work-up of MBC with or without positive oncological family history. Here, we review the literature, reporting recent data about this malignancy with a specific focus on epidemiology, and genetic and non-genetic risk factors. We introduce the perspective of cancer genetic counseling for MBC patients and their healthy at-risk family members, with a focus on different hereditary cancer syndromes. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {In oncogenetics, some patients could be considered as “extreme phenotypes”, such as those with very early onset presentation or multiple primary malignancies, unusually high numbers of cancers of the same spectrum or rare cancer types in the same parental branch. For these cases, a genetic predisposition is very likely, but classical candidate gene panel analyses often and frustratingly remains negative. In the framework of the EX2TRICAN project, exploring unresolved extreme cancer phenotypes, we applied exome sequencing on rare familial cases with male breast cancer, identifying a novel pathogenic variant of ATR (p.Leu1808*). ATR has already been suspected as being a predisposing gene to breast cancer in women. We next identified 3 additional ATR variants in a cohort of both male and female with early onset and familial breast cancers (c.7762-2A>C; c.2078+1G>A; c.1A>G).

Place and Duration of Study: Department of Internal Medicine, HSU Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncology, Training and Research Hospital, Turkey, between January 2010 and November 2018. Methodology: Data of patients with MBC were evaluated. Age ≥18 years, diagnosis of breast carcinoma, and male gender were the inclusion criteria of the study. Patients were excluded from the study, if their data were incomplete. Ki-67, the status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 receptor were obtained from the hospital records. Kaplan-Meier method was performed for survival analysis. Cox regression analysis was used to determine independent prognostic factors of overall survivall (OS). Results: Out of the 73 patients included in the study, 37 of them aged under 65, while 36 of them aged 65 or over. ER positivity was 94.5%, while PR positivity was 87.7%, and HER2 positivity was 13.7%. It was found that as a result of the univariate analysis, the 5-year OS of the elderly group (≥65 years) was lower compared to the younger group (<65 years, 74.2% vs. 93.3%, p=0.022). Age, tumor grade, and T stage were included in the multivariate Cox regression analysis and only advanced age was found to be an independent poor prognostic factor (HR: 3.068, 95% CI: 1.013-9.293, p=0.047). Conclusion: Advanced age might be an independent poor prognostic factor for patients with MBC. © 2020 College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for less than 1% of breast cancer, requiring extrapolation of results from studies in women. The aim of the study is to evaluate prognostic and therapeutic factors with special focus in endocrine treatment (ET) on the disease outcome. Methods: Observational, retrospective, single-center study of 53 MBC treated between January 1997 and December 2018 participated in the study. Among the participants, 48 patients had a performance status (PS) 0-1 (91%), 48 were hormone-receptor-positive (91%) and 4 were human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2) positive (8%). A total of 45 patients (85%) were treated with ET, with 36 patients (68%) receiving treatment in an adjuvant setting. The association analysis was performed using Chi-square test and survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier with SPSS v25. Results: The cohort had a median age of 68 years old (range: 40-88). We found that 84% had a non-metastatic breast cancer. A breast cancer gene (BRCA) analysis was carried out in 43% of the patients, showing BRCA2 mutated in 26.1% of those analyzed, without obtaining a benefit in overall survival (P=0.698). The analysis showed higher 5-year overall survival (OS) for PS 0 (P=0.010), absence of vascular invasion (P=0.033), Ki67 ≤14% (P=0.041) and absence of metastasis at diagnosis (p<0.0001). Patients receiving adjuvant ET above 5 years had a longer median OS (89 vs 69.6 months, P=0.024), disease-free survival (DFS), and distant relapse (84 vs 48 months; P=0.005, and P=0.002, respectively). Conclusions: Several prognostic factors for male breast cancer have been described. Noteworthy, patients receiving adjuvant ET above 5 years had a higher OS and DFS. BRCA did not show prognostic value in OS in this cohort. Further studies with larger sample size are necessary. © Farname Scientific Publishing Inc.. All Rights Reserved.},

Male patients with BC from January 2006 to December 2018 were identified. Of 49 patients, mean age was 64 (range 33-94) years. Of the 27 (55.1%) patients who had genetic testing, 9 (33.3%) had a Breast Cancer gene (BRCA) 1 or 2 mutation. The majority of patients had a mastectomy (n = 43/49, 87.8%) and had invasive ductal carcinoma (n = 47/49, 95.9%). 20 patients (n = 20/43, 46.5%) had positive lymph nodes. 41 (n = 41/47, 87.2%) patients had estrogen receptor positive disease. The majority of patients were pathologic stage 2 (n = 21/46, 45.7%), followed by stage 1 (n = 15/46, 32.6%), stage 3 (n = 6/46, 13.0%), and stage 4 (n = 4/46, 8.7%). Eight patients had the 21-gene recurrence score performed. Of patients with stage 1-3 BC, 10 (n = 10/43, 23.3%) patients had recurrence. With median follow-up of 4.1 (range.6-10.6) years, 5-year overall survival was 82.9% and 5-year disease-free survival was 65.9%. In conclusion, our cohort of patients with male BC had a high incidence of BRCA mutations and most commonly had high-grade estrogen positive stage 2 tumors.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is now considered molecularly different from female breast cancer (FBC). Evidence from studies indicates that common genetic and epigenetic features of FBC are not shared with those diagnosed in men. Genetic predisposition is likely to play a significant role in the tumorigenesis of this rare disease. Inherited germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for around 2% and 10% of MBC cases, respectively, and the lifetime risk of breast cancer for men harboring BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is 1.2% and 6.8%. As for FBC, pathogenic mutations in other breast cancer genes have also been recently associated with an increased risk of MBC, such as PALB2 and CHEK2 mutations. However, while multigene germline panels have been extensively performed for BC female patients, the rarity of MBC has resulted in limited data to allow the understanding of the magnitude of risk and the contribution of recently identified moderate penetrance genes of FBC for MBC predisposition. This review gathers available data about the germline genetic landscape of men affected by breast cancer, estimated risk associated with these genetic variants, and current guidelines for clinical management. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease that tends to occur in elderly men. Little is known about the causes of death in MBC because of the small sample size of most studies. This study aimed to investigate the causes of death in MBC patients. Patients and Methods: MBC patient data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1975-2016). Time trends of MBC mortality in the US population were analyzed using Joinpoint software. We calculated the proportion of each cause of death in the overall cohort and in different patient subgroups. Competing risk models were used to calculate cumulative mortality at different follow-up times. The risk of cardiovascular death (CVD) in MBC patients was compared to that of the age-matched general population by calculating standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Results: In total, 6426 patients were included in the analysis. MBC mortality rate increased between 2004 and 2019 (annual percentage change=1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.50, 1.80). There were 1757 patients (27.3%) who died of non-breast cancer causes. CVD was the leading cause of death in patients who were elderly or had localized disease. MBC patients had a 6.58-fold higher risk of CVD than the general population (SMR=6.58, 95% CI: 6.14, 7.05). Conclusion: Non-breast cancer death accounts for the majority of deaths in MBC patients who are elderly or have localized cancer. Compared to the general population, MBC patients have an increased risk of CVD. These results highlight the importance of monitoring cardiovascular comorbidities in MBC patients. © 2021 Zhang et al.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Male Breast Cancer (MBC) is a rare disease, about 1% of all breast cancers worldwide and less than 1% of cancers occurring in men. The bilateral male breast cancer (bMBC) is extremely rare. Germline mutations of BRCA1/BRCA2 genes are associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer in MBC; the role of PALB2 remains to be clarified. Our main goal was to provide contribution on characterization of BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2 mutations in MBC patients. Methods: We observed 28 MBC cases; one of them was a bMBC. Screening for BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2 genes was performed on all 28 MBC patients. Mutational analysis was extended to family members of mutated patients. Results: In our study, the MBC incidence was 5.2% and for bMBC was 3.6%. Mutation analysis showed pathogenic mutations in 11/28 (39.3%) patients; 2/28 (7.1%) displayed a mutation in BRCA1, 8/28 (28.6%) in BRCA2 and 1/28 (3.6%) in PALB2. Out of 11 mutated patients, one (9.1%) reported a double mutation in BRCA2. Personal history of other cancers was reported in 2/28 (7.1%) patients affected by bladder cancer. A first/second degree family history of breast/ovarian and other cancers occurred in 23/28 (82.1%) patients. Conclusion: Our findings indicate BRCA2 as the main MBC susceptibility gene and describe an increased risk of bMBC and bladder cancer in mutated patients. The identification of mutations in MBC susceptibility genes supports the usage of oncology prevention programs in affected patients and their relatives carrying the mutation. © 2020},

	abstract = {Introduction: The G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor 1 (GPER-1) is a potential prognostic marker in breast cancer. However, its role in male breast cancer (MBC) is still unknown. This study evaluates the expression of GPER-1 in MBC samples and correlates these data with clinical and pathological parameters including patients' survival. Material and methods: For this retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained cohort of patients with MBC, we examined 161 specimens for GPER-1 expression using immunohistochemistry. An immunoreactive score (IRS) was calculated based on staining intensity and the percentage of positive tumour cells. Then, we correlated GPER-1 IRS with clinical and pathological parameters, and overall and relapse-free survival. Results: About 40% of MBC samples were positive for GPER-1 expression (IRS ≥ 4). There was no significant correlation with clinicopathological parameters, such as hormone receptor status or grading. However, a statistical trend was observed for tumour size (≥ 2 cm, p = 0.093). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed no significant correlation with relapse-free survival. However, there was a significant correlation with overall survival, but when we adjusted the log-rank p-value to compensate for the cut-off point optimization method, it rose above 0.1. Additionally, GPER-1-positive patients were older at diagnosis. When adjusted for age by multivariable Cox regression analysis, the significance of GPER-1 status for survival was further reduced. Conclusions: We found no significant prognostic value of GPER-1 in this MBC cohort as anticipated from studies on female BC. Future studies with higher sample size are needed to further verify a potential sex-specific role of GPER-1. © 2021 Termedia Publishing House Ltd.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Male Breast Cancer (MBC) is a rare and aggressive disease that is associated with genetic factors. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for 10% of all MBC cases suggesting that other genetic factors are involved. The aim of the present study is to screen whole BRCA1 and BRCA2 exons using the Ampliseq BRCA panel in Tunisian MBC patients with family history. Furthermore, we performed exome sequencing using the TruSight One sequencing panel on an early onset BRCA negative patient. We showed that among the 6 MBC patients, only one (MBC-F1) harbored a novel frameshift mutation in exon 2 of the BRCA2 gene (c.17-20delAAGA, p.Lys6Xfs) resulting in a short BRCA2 protein of only 6 amino-acids. We selected 9 rare variants after applying several filter steps on the exome sequencing data. Among these variants, and based on their role in breast carcinogenesis, we retained 6 candidate genes (MSH5, DCC, ERBB3, NOTCH3, DIAPH1, and DNAH11). Further studies are needed to confirm the association of the selected genes with family MBC. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: There were no predictive prognosis factors of serum in male breast cancer, while breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. The purpose of our study was to determine the prognostic implications of the pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) in the serum of patients with male breast cancer. Methods: We retrospectively identified a random cohort of male breast cancer patients treated at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between Jan 1, 1996 and Dec 31, 2016. A number of 108 patients had different inflammation markers recorded pre-operation. Survival status was retrieved from our cancer center registry and phone follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Among these patients in this study, 13 (12.0%) had disease recurrence, and 7 (6.5%) patients appeared distant metastasis. No statistically significant association of the preoperative NLR, PLR or LMR level with patients' different outcomes was found. Conclusions: In short, we were unable to establish a connection between preoperative inflammation biomarkers and male breast cancer patients' survival. Neither NLR, PLR nor LMR is useful for predicting prognosis in male breast cancer patients, and prospective studies to evaluate the above biomarkers as a simple prognostic trail is necessary. © 2021 AME Publishing Company.

	abstract = {Background: Emerging data suggest screening mammography may be effective in detecting breast cancer early in high-risk men. We evaluated current screening recommendations as a risk management strategy in men at elevated risk for breast cancer. Patients and Methods: This institutional review board–approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant study reviewed consecutive men who underwent genetic counseling and multigene panel testing (MGPT) for breast cancer risk assessment at our institution between 2012 and 2018. Patient risk factors, test indications, and MGPT outcomes were recorded, then correlated with screening recommendations by either clinical breast examination or screening mammography. Recommendation consistency among practitioners was evaluated. Patient adherence to screening mammography (defined as undergoing screening mammography as recommended) was assessed. Statistical analysis was performed at the 2-sided 5% significance level. Results: A total of 414 asymptomatic men underwent both genetic counseling and MGPT (mean age, 47 years; range, 18-91 years) for breast cancer risk assessment. Of this group, 18 (4.3%) of 414 had a personal history of breast cancer, and 159 (38.4%) of 414 had a family history of breast cancer before MGPT. Among 112 men with positive MGPT results, BRCA1/2 mutations were the most common (56.3%, 63/112). Most BRCA mutation carriers (80.9%, 51/63) were recommended clinical breast examination only. Only 5.9% (2/34) BRCA2 and 10.3% (3/29) BRCA1 carriers were recommended screening mammograms (7.9%, 5/63 of all BRCA carriers). Among men with a personal history of breast cancer, only 9 (50%) of 18 were recommended screening mammograms. Overall adherence to screening mammogram in men was 71.4% (10/14), which ultimately yielded two cancers. Breast cancer screening recommendations varied widely among practitioners, with some recommending clinical breast examination only, and others also recommending mammography. Conclusion: Men who are found to be at an elevated risk for breast cancer after undergoing genetic counseling and testing currently receive relatively inconsistent screening recommendations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.; Mammography screening is the standard tool for early breast cancer detection in women. New data support utility of mammography screening in high-risk men. Current breast cancer risk management and screening recommendations remain inconsistent among high-risk men, with the majority undergoing clinical breast examination and a minority undergoing mammography screening. We provide male breast cancer risk assessment and screening recommendations in high-risk men who undergo genetic counseling and multigene panel testing. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (BC) is a distinct neoplasm with low but rising incidence, frequently diagnosed as advanced stage disease. Considering the relevance of altered homologous recombination repair (HRR) in male BC, we aimed to explore the biomarker potential of aberrant promoter methylation of ATM, BRCA1, PALB2, RAD51B, and XRCC3. Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from 128 male BC patients, paired adjacent normal tissue and 19 gynecomastia cases were collected and assessed by quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP). Non-parametric tests were used to compare methylation levels between tumor and non-tumor samples and to seek for associations with clinicopathological variables. Results: Only RAD51B and XRCC3 disclosed significant differences between tumor and gynecomastia (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.020, respectively). Assembled in a panel, RAD51B and XRCC3 promoter methylation discriminated male BC from gynecomastia with 91.5% sensitivity, 89.5% specificity, and 91.2% accuracy. Moreover, promoter methylation levels were lower in paired non-tumor tissues, comparing to tumor samples. No associations were found between epigenetic alterations and clinicopathological features, as well as with RAD51 and XRCC3 immunoexpression and methylation levels. Conclusion: Quantitative promoter methylation of RAD51B and XRCC3 constitutes a promising and accurate biomarker for male BC. Validation in larger series and in liquid biopsies is warranted to confirm its usefulness in detection and monitoring settings. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Rationale:Brain metastasis of male breast cancer is extremely rare, and the pathological changes between the primary tumor and the metastatic brain tumor have not been reported. Herein, we report for the first time a case of male breast cancer with metastasis to the parietal lobe with subtype conversion after metastasis.Patient concerns:we describe a 45-year-old male patient admitted for an incidentally found brain tumor after a motorcycle accident. The patient had been treated for breast cancer 5 years previously. The primary tumor was an invasive ductal carcinoma classified as pT1N1M0 with hormone receptor positivity (estrogen receptor ++, progesterone receptor +++, human epidermal growth factor receptor-type2 (HER2) +) and was treated with surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy and endocrine therapy (tamoxifen).Diagnoses:Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well enhanced focal solid tumor in the right parietal lobe (5.0 × 4.2 cm in size), Immunohistochemical staining revealed cerebral metastases of breast cancer with HER2 subtype conversion (estrogen receptor +++, progesterone receptor +++, HER2 -).Interventions:The patient was successfully treated with surgery and whole brain irradiation (3 Gy × 10 fractions).Outcomes:There was no additional complication after the surgery and the patient transferred to oncology department for chemotherapy. 2 years later, he had gamma knife radiosurgery due to the recurred brain lesion and after that he discontinued the treatment and opted for hospice care.Lessons:Male breast cancer with metastasis to the brain is an extremely rare condition. Although a few similar cases have been reported, subtype conversion in similar cases has not been reported. Therefore, we report this case of a male patient with brain metastasis of invasive ductal carcinoma with HER2 status conversion after metastasis.  © Copyright 2021 the Author(s).

Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we compared age, race, histological type, histological grade, tumor size, lymph node status, metastases, estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) and HER-2 status between male and female patients, and analyzed their relationships with OS. We established a nomogram and produced a calibration curve to observe its predictive effect. Results: Age, race, T stage, N stage, bone and lung metastases, and histological type and grade differed between male and female patients. OS in male patients was related to age, tumor size, metastatic site, ER/PR status, and histological grade, but not to race or lymph node status. A nomogram was established, which showed good predictive performance for survival in MBC patients (area under the curve = 0.7). Conclusion: MBC has a worse prognosis than female breast cancer, mainly characterized by late onset age, late staging, high proportion of invasive non-specific histological types, high histological grade, and luminal breast cancer. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is an infrequent disease and a scarcely researched topic. Since the incidence of male breast cancer is increasing and so far, management advices have been concluded from results of trials in female patients, there has been a growing interest in this field of research. Objectives: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the general, radiological and pathological features of MBC patients. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of MBC patients who had been referred to breast clinic, Shahid Motahari in Shiraz, Iran, between 2005 and 2018. Data regarding general characteristics of patients such as demographic in-formation, age, and also past history of any cancer, family history of breast cancer, mammogram and ultrasound findings, stage, size and location of tumor, histopathology of tumor, metastasis, treatment modalities and follow-up time were attained by reviewing medical records. Results: Fifty-one patients with MBC were included with the mean age of 58.4 years. Invasive ductal carcinoma was the most preva-lent pathologic type. By use of the Kaplan Meier survival estimate, survival probability of patients for each time interval after diagnosis was calculated. There was a decline over time until about 85 months after diagnosis when it reached a plateau state above 50%. Age, HER2 and metastasis showed to lower the survival time by increasing the hazard ratio. Only 13 patients had mammography and 22 had an ultrasound, which are less than 50% of the total number of patients. Conclusions: This study showed that there is still unfulfilled need to evaluate MBC in order to find the best management guidelines such as screening in high risk populations, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Risk factor evaluation, survival time, and diagnostic radiologic modalities have not been well assessed in MBC so far. © 2020, Author(s).},

	abstract = {Aim: To evaluate the epidemiology of male breast cancer (MBC) in Italy and to describe incidence and survival data in relation to age, morphology, year of incidence, geographic area, and possible association with other cancers compared with female BC. Methods: Cases were extracted from 40 Italian Cancer Registries. Standardized incidence rates (SIR), age-specific rates, and 5-year survival were calculated. The association with second tumors was also evaluated. All data were compared with data from female BCs. Results: In the 2000–2014 period, 2175 new cases of MBC were registered, with an SIR of 1.7 × 100,000. The incidence showed a slight upward trend and increased with increasing age. The 5-year survival was 82% in the first two periods (2000–2004, 2005–2009), lower than in females (87%). The most frequent morphology was the ductal carcinoma (84%). Stage at diagnosis was 39.5% stage I, 33.1% stage II, 20.9% in stage III, and 6.4% in stage IV. Concerning receptor status, 96.4% had ER+ and 82.5% PR+; 46.5% had high Ki67 and 14.7% HER2 amplified. The risk of BC increased if the man had already had a previous tumor in any site (excess absolute risk, EAR = 2.7) and especially if he had had prostate cancer (EAR = 5.1). Instead, males with a previous diagnosis of BC had an increased risk of testicular, kidney and lung cancer. Conclusions: MBC requires more attention in terms of diagnosis and treatment as clinicians tend to follow the guidelines that have been developed for female BC management. © 2020, The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Objective: Knowledge regarding the occupational rehabilitation of male breast cancer patients (MBCPs) is currently scarce; however, there may exist unmet needs of men affected by this rare disease. Therefore, this exploratory study investigated the experiences of MBCPs in their return to work (RTW). Methods: Interview data from 14 men with a breast cancer diagnosis were used for qualitative content analysis. Data were collected within the mixed-methods N-MALE project (Male breast cancer: patients' needs in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and follow-up care), conducted in Germany from 2016 to 2018. Results: The eight identified motives for RTW were desire for normalcy, distraction, need for activity, social contacts, work as a source of pleasure, financial considerations, lack of self-perception of illness, and having a job requiring low physical effort. The participants reported positive experiences with their workplaces from diagnosis through RTW. However, stigmatisation occurred. The aftermath of the disease and treatment led to changes in the interviewees' productivity, for instance due to fatigue. Conclusion: The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of RTW processes, as new insights were gained about motives and experiences particular to MBCPs. Support needs after return were apparent and may help to reduce long-term effects that limit productivity. © 2021 The Authors. European Journal of Cancer Care published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The role of genetic predisposition in male breast cancer (MBC) patients who test negative for a BRCA mutation is unclear. The aim of this study is to define the association between MBC and family history of breast cancer in patients without mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Methods: We conducted an unmatched case–control study with men who received commercial testing for germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes, including 3,647 MBC cases who tested negative for deleterious mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2, and 4,269 men with a personal history of colorectal cancer who tested negative for mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes to serve as controls. Associations between family history of breast cancer and MBC were estimated using unconditional multivariable logistic regression with adjustment for age, race/ethnicity and year of testing. Results: Breast cancer in a first- or second-degree relative was associated with a four-fold increased odds of MBC (OR 4.7; 95% CI 4.1, 5.3). Associations with MBC were strongest for family history of breast cancer in 2 or more first-degree relatives (FDR) (OR 7.8; 95% CI 5.2, 11.6), for probands and FDR diagnosed at age < 45 years (OR 6.9; 95% CI 3.9, 12.4), and for family history of MBC (OR 17.9; 95% CI 7.6, 42.1). Findings were confirmed in a sensitivity analysis of MBC cases who tested negative on a 25-gene pan-cancer panel. Conclusions: MBC patients without mutations in BRCA1/2 have significantly higher odds of a family history of breast cancer, suggesting the existence of unidentified MBC susceptibility alleles. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with local lymph nodes metastasis (TNM stage: T4N3M0). After surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy he was diagnosed with ureter metastasis because of hematuria. This patient took a Precitype gene test (immune index and PAM50) after several lines of treatment and the result indicated that this was a Luminal A subtype case as well as HER-2 mRNA positive, which was quite different from his immunohistochemical staining. Because of his poor condition and he could not tolerate chemotherapy, we adjusted his therapeutic regimen with endocrine therapy and anti-HER-2 therapy according to the gene expression analysis with the informed consent of the patient and his families. However, it seemed that there was no obvious efficacy and he passed away five months later. In our opinion, MBC patients with urinary symptoms should be considered for the possibility of metastasis although urinary metastasis in breast cancer is rare. We still need more research about gene expression analysis and more evidence of treatment recommendations for MBC. © Annals of Palliative Medicine. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease. Due to its rarity, treatment is still directed by data mainly extrapolated from female breast cancer (FBC) treatment, despite the fact that it has recently become clear that MBC has its own molecular characteristics. DDX3 is a RNA helicase with tumor suppressor and oncogenic potential that was described as a prognosticator in FBC and can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors of DDX3. The aim of this study was to evaluate if DDX3 is a useful prognosticator for MBC patients. Nuclear as well as cytoplasmic DDX3 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in a Dutch retrospective cohort of 106 MBC patients. Differences in 10-year survival by DDX3 expression were analyzed using log-rank test. The association between clinicopathologic variables, DDX3 expression, and survival was tested in uni- and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. High cytoplasmic DDX3 was associated with high androgen receptor (AR) expression while low nuclear DDX3 was associated with negative lymph node status. Nuclear and cytoplasmic DDX3 were not associated with each other. In a univariate analysis, high cytoplasmic DDX3 (p = 0.045) was significantly associated with better 10-year overall survival. In multivariate analyses, cytoplasmic DDX3 had independent prognostic value (p = 0.017). In conclusion, cytoplasmic DDX3 expression seems to be a useful prognosticator in MBC, as high cytoplasmic DDX3 indicated better 10-year survival. © 2021, The Author(s).},

This review will revise all available data that could improve the treatment of MaBC, with a special focus on adjuvant systemic treatments.Recent findingsTo date, men with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, who are candidates for adjuvant endocrine therapy, should be offered tamoxifen (TAM) for five years. Additional five years are possible, according to tolerance and recurrence risk. If TAM is contraindicated, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist and aromatase inhibitor should be proposed. Chemotherapy and targeted therapy in the other breast cancer subtypes should be used with the same indications offered to women with breast cancer. All men with breast cancer should be offered genetic counseling and germline genetic testing of cancer predisposition genes.SummaryFor decades, men with breast cancer have been treated suboptimally and denied the participation in clinical trials. Recently, many clinical trials started enrolling both genders, as strongly endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration. Hopefully, this turnaround will help subdue the disparities in the quality of care. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This is a retrospective study of the incidence and clinical profile of male breast cancer (MBC) presenting to a rural cancer center in Punjab, India. All MBC cases registered over a period of 4.5 years from January 2015 to July 2019 were included. The study included 34 MBC patients accounting for 1.9% of all breast cancer cases with median age of 62.5 years. All patients were from Punjab except one, with majority from district Sangrur. Family history was present in 7 (20.6%) patients. Mean BMI (n = 23) was 24.8. The median duration of symptoms was 6 months (range 1–60 months). Main complaint was lump in 58.8% of patients followed by lump with ulceration (41.2%). All cases were mostly unilateral, left in 21 (61.8%) and right in 13 (38.2%), and one had bilateral breast cancer. Most tumors were centrally located (70.6%). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma and grade 3 were the commonest histology. ER positivity was high seen in 76.5% cases. In our study, 16 (47.1%) patients presented with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis, and 10 (39.1%) were locally advance. Bone (41%) followed by lung (17%) were the most common sites of metastasis. Thirteen patients were treated radically, nine were treated with palliative intent, and twelve patients defaulted. Median follow-up period was 16.5 months. MBC constituted 1.9% of all breast cancers registered at our institute, which is higher than worldwide average. Our study population had a longer time to presentation, and majority were metastatic. © 2021, Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease with a rising incidence trend. The major risk factors related to MBC are a positive family history of breast cancer (BC) and BRCA1/2 mutations, which indicate a relevant genetic role. Methods: In this retrospective series, we enrolled 69 male patients presenting with male breast cancer (MBC) between 01/01/1992 and 31/12/2018, and 26 high-risk not-affected men presenting between 01/01/2016 and 31/12/2018. Participants' electronic clinical records were reviewed. Patients' data reported age at diagnosis, tumor characteristics, therapeutic management, and BRCA1/2 status as well as a family history of breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer (PCa) in first-degree relatives. Results: We analyzed 69 MBC patients. Median age was 64 years. The majority of tumors diagnosed were of an early TNM stage. The most frequent histological subtype was invasive ductal carcinoma (76.7%). Hormone receptors were positive in >90% of MBC cases. Nearly all patients underwent modified radical mastectomy or total mastectomy. Adjuvant endocrine therapy was delivered in 59.4%. Among MBC-affected patients, we recorded a high percentage of a positive family history of BC. Mutational analysis for the BRCA1/2 genes was performed in 17 MBC patients; 11.8% were carriers of BRCA2 pathogenic mutations. Among 26 healthy high-risk subjects included in this case series, 4 were BRCA1 mutation carriers and 9 were BRCA2 mutation carriers. Discussion: We evaluated the distribution of clinicopathological characteristics in MBC subjects and assessed the frequency of mutations in the BRCA genes in affected patients and healthy high-risk subjects, with the aim of proposing a surveillance program for BC and PCa. © 2019 S.

	abstract = {Introduction: F18-FDG PET/CT is the most important hybrid imaging used in the diagnostic, staging, follow-up, and treatment evaluation response in cancer patients. However, it is well-known that in breast cancer the use of F18-FDG is not included in the first line protocol of initial diagnostic, both in female and male breast cancer patients. F18-FDG PET/CT is a valuable tool to provide information on extra-axillary lymph node involvement, distant metastases, and other occult primary cancers. This study assesses F18-FDG PET/CT systemic staging in male patients with diagnosed breast cancer and determines detection rates for unsuspected distant metastases and synchronous malignancies. Methods: We analyzed a number of 170 male patients with breast cancer, seen between 2000–2020, in a tertiary center. From this group, between 2013–2020 a number of 23 patients underwent F18-FDG PET/CT. Rates of upstaging were determined for each case and the detection of other primary malignancies was analyzed. Results: Median age of male breast cancer group was 61.3 y (range, 34–85 y), most had intraductal carcinoma (82.4%) and unsuspected distant metastases, which increased patient stage to IV, observed in 27%. In 4 out 23 patients (17.4%), F18-FDG PET/CT identified synchronous cancers (2 prostate cancers, 1 thyroid and 1 colon cancer). Conclusion: F18-FDG PET/CT is a valuable tool to provide information on extra-axillary lymph node involvement, distant metastases, and other occult primary cancers. Baseline F18-FDG PET/CT has a substantial impact on the initial staging and on clinical management in male breast patients and should be considered for use in newly diagnosed patients. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for < 1% of all breast cancers. The available data on male breast cancer is mainly retrospective institution-based studies. Due to the scarcity of the disease, randomized controlled trials have not been feasible. Conducting a multicenter study is the next best option to assess the effectiveness of the treatment which is currently followed as per the guidelines on female breast cancer (FBC). Under the aegis of Delhi Breast Oncology Group (DBOG), data of 106 MBC patients was collected from 11 leading hospitals of Delhi and analyzed from January 2010 to April 2017. The age of the patients ranged from 35 to 82 years with a median of 59 years. The commonest presentation was a lump in the breast (98%). There was a delay in presentation of 1–6 months in the majority (86%) of cases. of the total number of patients, 51% had Stage II, 25% Stage III, 18% Stage I, 4% Stage 0, and 2% Stage IV breast cancer at the time of presentation. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the commonest histopathological finding. IHC receptor studies revealed ER positivity in 81% and PR positivity in 76%. HER2 neu positivity was seen in 25% of cases. Modified radical mastectomy was the commonest (92%) surgical procedure. Of the total number of cases, 18% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 35% received adjuvant chemotherapy, 32% underwent radiotherapy, and 74% received hormonal therapy. The 5-year cumulative disease-free survival was 60.7%. MBC is rare and unique. There are differences from FBC with respect to time of presentation, aggressiveness, histopathology, IHC markers, and response to treatment with a poorer outcome. Multicentric prospective studies are recommended for future research. © 2019, Association of Surgeons of India.},

	abstract = {Background: The prognostic effect of molecular subtypes on male breast cancer (MBC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological and prognostic factors of MBC patients. Methods: From 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2014, the data of 152 MBC and 304 female breast cancer (FBC) patients were identified and extensively compared. Results: Compared with the FBC group, MBC patients were found to have a higher rate of cancer family history (30.9% vs. 18.4%, P = 0.001), mass around the areola area (37.5% vs. 5.6%, P = 0.000), lymph node invasion (44.1% vs. 34.2%, P = 0.006) and hormonal receptor positivity (66.4% vs. 49.3%, P = 0.027). Luminal A was the most common subtype accounting for 69.8%, whereas HER2-positive (12.7%) and TNBC (1.6%) subtypes were rare in the MBC group. However, it was significantly lower for MBC than for FBC who received endocrine therapy (38.8% vs. 49.3%, P = 0.041). MBC showed the worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than those of FBC patients. However, 10-year OS and DFS were similar between MBC and FBC patients in the subgroups of nonluminal subtype (P < 0.001), but worse in MBC patients than those in FBC patients in the subgroups of luminal A (P = 0.004 for OS; P = 0.002 for DFS) and luminal B (P = 0.006 for OS; P = 0.003 for DFS). Multivariate analysis indicated tumor size, radical mastectomy and endocrine therapy as independent risk factors for OS and DFS of MBC patients. Conclusions: Our study determined that MBC patients possessed a worse prognosis, usually with lymph node invasion, and were estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-negative. Molecular subtypes based on FBC did not provide the same prognostic information in MBC, even in the luminal groups. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Objective: To comprehensively describe the tumor and clinical characteristics of breast cancer in a cohort of male patients and to assess the factors that affect survival. Background: Much of the standard care of male breast cancer is based on the diagnosis and treatment strategies of female breast cancer. However, important clinical differences between the two have been elucidated, which suggests the need for unique attention to male breast cancer. Methods: We evaluated the records of male patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004 and 2015 using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Data obtained were demographic characteristics, clinical and tumor data, type of therapy, as well as survival data. We used descriptive statistics to characterize our study population. We then performed a survival and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results: We identified 16,498 patients (median age: 63 years). Several treatment modalities were used, of which surgery was the most common (14,882 [90.4%]). The total follow-up time was 13 years (156 months). Five-year survival was 77.7% (95% CI 76.9–78.4) and 10-year survival was 60.7%. In a Cox proportional hazards model, mastectomy was associated with the greatest survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.49; p < 0.001). Conclusion: We report what is to our knowledge the largest national population-based cohort of male breast cancer patients. Importantly, our data suggests that similar to female patients, several treatment modalities are significantly associated with improved survival in male patients, particularly surgery. Increasing age, black race, government insurance, more comorbidities, and higher tumor stages are associated with decreased survival. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Male breast cancer is an uncommon disease, and population-based information regarding prognostic factors is limited. Most cases are hormone receptor (HR) positive; however, the association of tumor subtype with overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) is unclear. Methods: Using SEER data, we identified men with invasive breast cancer between 2010 and 2017 with known HR and HER2 status. We examined tumor subtypes by patient characteristics and performed multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses to determine the associations of each variable with OS and BCSS. Results: We included 2389 men with a median follow-up of 43 months (IQR 19–68). Median age was 66 years. Tumor subtype distribution was 84.1% HR+/HER2−, 12.7% HR+/HER2+ , 0.8% HR−/HER2+, and 2.3% triple-negative (TN). In univariate analysis, OS at 5 years was 76.5% for HR+/HER2−, 65.1% for HR+/HER2+ , 84.2% for HR-/HER2+, and 48.1% for TN (p < 0.0001). Of all subtypes, TN had the worst BCSS (p < 0.0001). Stage, tumor subtype and race were significantly associated with OS and BCSS in multivariate analysis. Adjusted Cox hazard ratios for OS by tumor subtype with HR+/HER2− as reference were 1.55 for HR+/HER2+ (p = 0.001), 1.1 for HR−/HER2+ (p = 0.888), and 3.59 for TN (p < 0.001). Conclusion: We observed significant differences in survival outcomes by tumor subtype. Poor outcomes among men with HER2+ and TN disease suggest possible under-treatment, aggressive tumor biology, and/or more advanced disease at presentation. Studies to better understand the inferior survival for men with these subtypes are warranted and will likely require international collaboration. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {A 60-year-old Chinese male with a hard mass, pressure pain, and ulcerous skin under his left axilla was first diagnosed with apocrine carcinoma, most likely metastasis from breast cancer. PET/CT scan detected multiple bone metastasis and enlarged lymph nodes at left axilla, mediastinal area 7, and left pulmonary hilus. Lumpectomy was performed to remove the mass followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy against focal bone metastasis, left axillary lesion, and left subcutaneous chest wall. PET/CT examination showed progressive disease after the completion of the treatments. Two nontender hard nodules were noticed on the patient's left upper arm and multiple immobile nodules were palpated under his left axillary skin. Immunohistochemistry (HER2++, ER+, PR+, AR-) of the biopsy tissue combined with histopathology indicated invasive ductal carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Metastatic Luminal B subtype breast cancer was preferred. Anti-estrogen endocrine therapy was then performed and PET/CT scan showed partial remission after one month's fulvestrant administration. Two significant somatic mutations, AR R616H and GATA3 S408Afs∗99, were detected in the biopsy tissue by next-generation sequencing. GATA3 is associated with estrogen receptor signaling and was identified as a driver gene of female breast cancer. However, the function of GATA3 in male breast cancer remains controversial. Report of this case hopefully will contribute to exploring the role of GATA3 mutation in molecular mechanisms and endocrine therapy of male breast cancer. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Previous studies have suggested that several factors significantly increase the risk of MBC. Prolactinoma has the highest incidence rate among patients with functional pituitary tumors. However, whether prolactinoma is involved in the onset and progression of breast cancer remains unclear. To date, there are only five case reports globally on MBC with concurrent prolactinoma. We hereby describe the first case of MBC with prolactinoma in China. We also explored the patient's genetic profile using whole exome sequencing. Our findings may help advance our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of MBC.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Hospital utilization and costs of female breast cancer have been well documented. However, evidence focusing on male breast cancer is scarce, despite the different clinical characteristics between female and male breast cancer. We aim to estimate hospital length of stay (LOS) and costs associated with male breast cancer in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. METHODS: We analyzed the 2012-2016 Health Care Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample of 416 hospitalization events of male patients with breast cancer. Patients who had breast cancer diagnoses were selected based on the primary International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision or Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. A negative binomial regression and a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and log-link function were conducted to estimate the LOS and hospital costs after controlling for sociodemographics, clinical characteristics (eg, metastatic status, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index [ECI] score), and hospital characteristics. RESULTS: On average, male patients with breast cancer stayed for 2.42 days and expensed $9059 per hospital visit. Patients with metastatic status had longer LOS (5.39 vs 3.24 days; P = .005) and higher hospital costs ($11,185 vs $8547; P = .03) than those without. Patients with an ECI score of 3 or more showed longer LOS (4.05 vs 2.68 days; P = .003) and higher hospital costs ($10,043 vs $7022; P < .001) than those with an ECI score of 0. CONCLUSIONS: LOS and hospital costs for male patients with breast cancer were associated with metastatic status and comorbidities. This information can be used to assess the health care resources needed to treat male breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Background: Due to the lack of prospective data, current treatment of male breast cancer (MBC) is based on information obtained from retrospective analysis or by extrapolation from studies on female patients. In this prospectively enrolled cohort study, we retrospectively examined the survival effect of tamoxifen in MBC patients. Methods: In this prospectively enrolled cohort study, 448 patients with MBC were treated between May 2009 and June 2018. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Results: Between May 2009 and June 2018, 448 men with breast cancer were identified, with a median age at diagnosis of 69 years (range 27–96 years). The median follow-up was 39 months (range 3–89 months). Most tumours were larger than 20 mm; invasive ductal carcinoma was of no special histological type and with an intermediate grade of differentiation. Almost half of the men were diagnosed with positive axillary lymph nodes (43.5%). Hormone receptor (HR) positivity was observed in 98.4% of the patients. Notably, DFS among men who did not receive tamoxifen was significantly reduced as compared with those who underwent tamoxifen therapy (P = 0.002). The recurrence rate and mortality in the group of patients without and with tamoxifen treatment were 18.2% and 11.2%, respectively. The most common localisation of metastases was the bone. After adjustment for prognostic factors, we found that tamoxifen was found to reduce the recurrence rate by 68% (hazard ratio HR = 0.32; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.14–0.74). Conclusions: Tamoxifen treatment was associated with improved DFS for MBC patients. Clinical trial registration: DRKS00009536. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Cancer Research UK.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the pathological and radiological features, immunohistochemical profile and treatment methods of primary male breast carcinoma cases diagnosed at our center. Material and Method: The pathology archive between 2006 and 2019 was reviewed and the data of 27 male patients diagnosed as primary breast cancer were retrospectively evaluated. Results: The age of the patients ranged between 40-86 years. The left breast was involved in 17 patients. The mean tumor diameter was 2.35 ± 1.09 cm. Of the 27 cases, 8 were dead and 19 were alive. The mean follow-up duration was 37.45 ± 24.84 months. The mean estimated life expectancy was 65±14.7 months. The most common complaint was a swelling in the breast. The time interval between the onset of complaints and admittance to hospital ranged from three months to two years. The most common histopathological diagnosis was invasive carcinoma-no special type. The most common surgical procedure was mastectomy with lymph node dissection. Nine patients had metastatic lymph nodes. In terms of the hormone profiles, 24 were Estrogen receptor positive, 21 were Progesterone receptor positive and six were Her2/neu positive. Three patients had triple-negative tumors. Conclusion: Male breast carcinoma is a rare disease but its frequency has been increasing recently. As breast cancer is more commonly attributed to women, the diagnosis is usually delayed until later stages in males. Public awareness should therefore be increased and breast cancer should be considered in the differential diagnosis especially in the presence of breast swelling and complaints related to the breast skin so that the appropriate biopsy can be obtained without delay. © 2020, Federation of Turkish Pathology Societies.

Characteristically, estrogen, progesterone receptors, negative, and overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are detected in patients with female neurofibromatosis breast cancers. In cases reported so far, estrogen and progesterone receptors have been evaluated as positive and HER2 negative in male patients. With the high possibility of breast cancer development in female patients with neurofibromatosis at an earlier age, prompt and careful evaluation is required in terms of both examination and radiological imaging.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease that is still to be fully understood. In female breast cancer, molecular subtyping by gene expression has proven its significance. In this study, we characterize a consecutive cohort of MBC patients surgically treated from 1997 to 2017, identified at our institution (N = 37), and report the association between molecular subtypes found by a surrogate panel of immunohistochemical (IHC) markers, and the PAM50 signature, as well as risk of recurrence score and overall survival for the different subtypes. PAM50 subtypes were determined using the nCounter FLEX system instrument and software. The distribution of molecular subtypes according to the PAM50 signature was as follows: 56% luminal B, 39% luminal A, and 5% basal-like. None of the tumors were HER2-enriched. Using IHC surrogate markers, we found 80% luminal B-like, 15% luminal A-like, and 5% basal-like. None were HER2-positive (non-luminal). We found a strong statistical association between subtypes found by PAM50 signature and the IHC surrogate markers (p < 0.001). Furthermore, we found luminal A tumors to be smaller in size compared to luminal B tumors (p = 0.04). Patients with luminal A subtype tumors had the lowest ROR scores with a mean of 39, whereas patients with luminal B subtype tumors had a mean ROR score of 69. Significant worse overall survival for luminal B tumors compared to luminal A tumors was seen (p = 0.02). Male breast cancer seems to be a mainly luminal disease, with luminal B being the most frequent subtype. Further studies are needed to ensure correct therapeutic strategies for this select group of patients. © 2020 Scandinavian Societies for Medical Microbiology and Pathology.

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is rare in men, but management is focused on tumor characteristics commonly found in female breast cancer. The tumor microenvironment of male breast cancer is less well understood, and insight may improve male breast cancer management. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-MET axis and the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCL12)/C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) axis are prognostic in women with breast cancer. We aimed to investigate these factors in male breast cancer and correlate them with patient survival. Methods: From 841 Dutch males with breast cancer who were enrolled in the EORTC 10085/TBCRC/BIG/NABCG International Male Breast Cancer Program (NCT01101425) and diagnosed between 1990 and 2010, archival primary tumor samples were collected. Tissue microarrays were constructed with 3 cores per sample and used for immunohistochemical analysis of HGF, c-MET, CXCL12, and CXCR4. Overall survival (OS) of the patients without metastases (M0) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The value of the markers regarding OS was determined using univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses, providing hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: Of 720 out of 841 patients, sufficient tissue was available for analysis; 487 out of 720 patients had M0 disease. Patients with high HGF expression and high CXCL12 expression had a superior OS (low vs high expression of both markers, 7.5 vs 13.0 years, hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.84, P = 0.001 [HGF]; 9.1 vs 15.3 years, HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45-0.87, P = 0.005 [CXCL12]). Multivariate analysis identified HGF as an independent predictor for OS (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47-0.88, P = 0.001). Conclusions: HGF and CXCL12 tumor expression appear to identify male breast cancer patients with a relatively good prognosis. Possibly, this could support male breast cancer-specific management strategies in the future. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Use of the Oncotype DX recurrence score (RS) has been widely adopted in women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER−) breast cancer (BC). Validation studies on the use of RS in male BC (MBC) are lacking. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the utilization of RS and association with chemotherapy recommendations in early-stage MBC compared with female BC (FBC). Methods: Using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), a retrospective review was performed for patients with T1/T2, node-negative, HR+/HER2− BC between 2010 and 2014. Patients were stratified by demographics, tumor characteristics, RS, and chemotherapy use comparing MBC with FBC over the allotted time period. Results: A total of 358,497 patients—3068 (0.8%) males and 355,429 (99.1%) females—met the inclusion criteria. A smaller proportion of MBC patients received RS testing compared with FBC patients (32% vs. 35%, p < 0.001). Male patients who had RS were younger, had T2 tumors, lymphovascular invasion, and private insurance. The distribution of RS was similar in both groups. Only 4% of MBC patients with low RS received adjuvant chemotherapy, compared with 4.9% of FBC patients. Overall chemotherapy rates were similar in MBC and FBC patients. Conclusions: Our results showed that RS has not been completely embraced in the management of MBC, although when performed in MBC, chemotherapy recommendations vary based on RS. Whether the use of RS affects the clinical outcomes of MBC is unknown. A prospective registry would help clarify and evaluate the impact of RS on clinical outcomes in MBC. © 2020, Society of Surgical Oncology.},

All the recruited patients were obese, old, and had recently been diagnosed with the disease. They had not received any treatment for the cancer until the time of the study. Melatonin and epinephrine serum levels were significantly higher in breast cancer patients compared to their age-matched controls, whereas ghrelin, dopamine, GABA, and serotonin serum levels were lower in patients compared to the control group.

Case report: A 68-year-old male patient presented with a 5-month history of a nodular lesion in the areolar region of the left breast accompanied by occasional pain and progressive growth. An ultrasound scan showed a heterogeneous lesion with irregular edges and calcifications, BIRADS V. It was decided to perform a mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, with positivity in the transoperative period, and axillary lymphadenectomy was completed. The histopathology report confirmed infiltrating ductal carcinoma, sentinel lymph node- and satellite-positive for metastatic carcinoma. Conclusion: Several questions remain unanswered about breast cancer in men. It is important to enhance understanding of the biology of the disease to identify the differences between the two sexes and thus determine if they have therapeutic implications. © 2020 SESPM},

	abstract = {Unlike female breast cancer, male breast cancer (MBC) is rare and not very well understood. Prospective data in the management of MBC are lacking and majority of treatment strategies are adopted from the established guidelines for breast cancer in women. The understanding of biology, clinical presentation, genetics, and management of MBC is evolving but there still remains a large knowledge gap due to the rarity of this disease. Older age, high estradiol levels, klinefelter syndrome, radiation exposure, gynecomastia, family history of breast cancer, BRCA2 and BRCA1 mutation are some of the known risk factors for MBC. Routine screening mammography is not recommended for asymptomatic men. Diagnostic mammogram with or without ultrasound should be considered if there is a suspicion for breast mass. Majority of men with early-stage breast cancer undergo mastectomy whereas breast conserving surgery (BCS) with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) remains an alternative option in selected cases. Since the majority of MBC are hormone receptor positive (HR+), adjuvant hormonal therapy is required. Tamoxifen for a total of 5 to 10 years is the mainstay adjuvant hormonal therapy. The role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer is uncertain and not commonly used. The role of gene recurrence scores like oncotype Dx and mammaprint is evolving and can be used as an aid for adjuvant chemotherapy. Majority of metastatic MBC are treated with hormonal therapy with either tamoxifen, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH) with aromatase inhibitors (AI), or fulvestrant. Chemotherapy is reserved for patients with visceral crisis or rapidly growing tumors. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Methods: A total of 90 MBC and 180 FBC patients were included in this retrospective study. The clinicopathological features, disease-free survival rate (DFSR), and overall survival rate (OSR) were compared between the two groups. Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the factors affecting the survival rates. Results: Most MBC were invasive ductal carcinoma (70/90, 77.8%) and luminal type (83/90, 92.2%), and were treated with modified radical mastectomy (78/90, 86.7%). Compared with women, there were more patients with one-set age of ≥70 years old, having family history of cancer, comorbid with underlying diseases in the male patients. They also had higher portion of patients at T3 and T4 stages. The rates of male patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy and endocrine therapy were lower (P<0.05) than female patients. OSR and DFSR were lower in the male patients than in the female patients (P<0.05). T stage, TNM stage, the status of progesterone receptor and endocrine therapy were independent prognostic factors for survival of MBC (P<0.05); TNM stage, chemotherapy or endocrine therapy were independent factors for survival of FBC (P<0.05). Conclusions: Compared with FBC, MBC occurs later with more underlying diseases and lower survival rates. MBC is less active in adjuvant therapy and endocrine therapy. Since MBC has more luminal type, increased endocrine therapy may improve the survival. © 2021 AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The etiology of male breast cancer (MBC) is poorly understood. In particular, the extent to which the genetic basis of MBC differs from female breast cancer (FBC) is unknown. A previous genome-wide association study of MBC identified 2 predisposition loci for the disease, both of which were also associated with risk of FBC. Methods: We performed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of European ancestry MBC case subjects and controls in 3 stages. Associations between directly genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms with MBC were assessed using fixed-effects meta-analysis of 1380 cases and 3620 controls. Replication genotyping of 810 cases and 1026 controls was used to validate variants with P values less than 1 × 10-06. Genetic correlation with FBC was evaluated using linkage disequilibrium score regression, by comprehensively examining the associations of published FBC risk loci with risk of MBC and by assessing associations between a FBC polygenic risk score and MBC. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Results: The genome-wide association study identified 3 novel MBC susceptibility loci that attained genome-wide statistical significance (P < 5 × 10-08). Genetic correlation analysis revealed a strong shared genetic basis with estrogen receptor-positive FBC. Men in the top quintile of genetic risk had a fourfold increased risk of breast cancer relative to those in the bottom quintile (odds ratio = 3.86, 95% confidence interval = 3.07 to 4.87, P = 2.08 × 10-30). Conclusions: These findings advance our understanding of the genetic basis of MBC, providing support for an overlapping genetic etiology with FBC and identifying a fourfold high-risk group of susceptible men. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer is a rare malignant disease, accounting for <1% of all breast cancers. The treatment of male breast cancer is mainly extrapolated from the enormous literature and clinical experience in women. The objective of the current study was to assess the relationship between adjuvant chemotherapy and survival in a large population-based cohort of patients with early-stage male breast cancer. Methods: Men with invasive stage I to stage III breast cancer were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer database from 1990 to 2014. The effect of chemotherapy on survival was determined using multivariable Cox regression. Results: Of 2713 male patients enrolled, 1817 (66.9%) did not receive chemotherapy. Age, T classification, N classification, tumor grade, and progesterone receptor (PR) status were found to be strong predictors of chemotherapy administration. Chemotherapy was associated with a significant 26% reduction in all-cause mortality (P <.001) and a marginally significant 21% reduction in breast cancer–specific mortality (P =.085). For men with PR-negative breast cancer, use of chemotherapy was associated with improved breast cancer–specific survival (hazards ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.28-0.91 [P =.023]) and overall survival (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37-0.77 [P =.001]). However, chemotherapy did not improve the breast cancer–specific survival for all men with PR-positive tumors (P =.959); it was associated with improved overall survival (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.92 [P =.004]) for men with PR-positive stage II and stage III breast cancer. Conclusions: Chemotherapy should be considered for men with PR-negative, nonmetastatic breast cancer and PR-positive, stage II and stage III breast cancer. © 2020 American Cancer Society},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) of the breast, a mesenchymal neoplasm with skeletal muscle differentiation, is an extremely rare tumour in males, with less than 30 cases published in English-language literature. We report on the first case of a male breast RMS, with an unusual ectomesenchymal/neuroectodermal component. CASE SUMMARY A 55-year-old, previously healthy male, underwent a radical left mastectomy for an ulcerated tumour mass, occupying the breast and left anterior thoracic wall. The biopsy specimen indicated the presence of a tumour with neural origins, namely a peripheral neuroectodermal tumour (PNET). The surgical specimens identified two components. The rhabdomyosarcomatous component (over 70%) was represented by large pleomorphic cells with positivity for desmin, sarcomeric actin and myogenin. The PNET-like ectomesenchymal component, which was admixed with the RMS cells, and was also revealed during the preoperative biopsy, consisted of small cells which expressed neurofilament, neuron specific enolase and CD99. The microscopic examination, along with the immunohistochemical profile, allowed the diagnosis of an RMS, with unusual ectomesenchymal differentiation. The patient refused the postoperative oncologic therapy and died three months after surgery. CONCLUSION In patients with RMS of the breast, the PNET-like ectomesenchymal component increases the diagnosis difficulty, especially in biopsy specimens. This differentiation can be immunohistochemically proven and might highlight the possible development of high-grade sarcoma of the breast from remnants of the embryological ectodermal layer. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare malignancy that accounts for about 1.8% of all breast cancer cases. In contrast to the high number of the “omics” studies in breast cancer in women, only recently molecular approaches have been performed in MBC research. High-throughput proteomics based methodologies are promisor strategies to characterize the MBC proteomic signatures and their association with clinico-pathological parameters. In this study, the label-free quantification-mass spectrometry and bioinformatics approaches were applied to analyze the proteomic profiling of a MBC case using the primary breast tumor and the corresponding axillary metastatic lymph nodes and adjacent non-tumor breast tissues. The differentially expressed proteins were identified in the signaling pathways of granzyme B, sirtuins, eIF2, actin cytoskeleton, eNOS, acute phase response and calcium and were connected to the upstream regulators MYC, PI3K SMARCA4 and cancer-related chemical drugs. An additional proteomic comparative analysis was performed with a primary breast tumor of a female patient and revealed an interesting set of proteins, which were mainly involved in cancer biology. Together, our data provide a relevant data source for the MBC research that can help the therapeutic strategies for its management. © 2021, Brazilian Journal of Genetics. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare and understudied disease compared with female BC. About 15% of MBCs are associated with germline mutation in BC susceptibility genes, mainly BRCA1/2 and PALB2. Hereditary MBCs are likely to represent a subgroup of tumors with a peculiar phenotype. Here, we performed a whole transcriptome analysis of MBCs characterized for germline mutations in the most relevant BC susceptibility genes in order to identify molecular subtypes with clinical relevance. A series of 63 MBCs, including 16 BRCA2, 6 BRCA1, 2 PALB2, 1 RAD50, and 1 RAD51D germline-mutated cases, was analyzed by RNA-sequencing. Differential expression and hierarchical clustering analyses were performed. Module signatures associated with central biological processes involved in breast cancer pathogenesis were also examined. Different transcriptome profiles for genes mainly involved in the cell cycle, DNA damage, and DNA repair pathways emerged between MBCs with and without germline mutations. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed two distinct subgroups, one of which was characterized by a higher expression of immune response genes, high scores of gene-expression signatures suggestive of aggressive behavior, and worse overall survival. Our results suggest that transcriptome matched with germline profiling may be a valuable approach for the identification and characterization of MBC subtypes with possible relevance in the clinical setting. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background and objective: Male breast cancer is a rare and understudied disease. In addition to coping with cancer, suffering from what is perceived as a “woman's disease” significantly burdens men's illness experience and can lead to stigmatization. The way men cope with these challenges has not been studied to date. Drawing on stigma, coping, and destigmatization theories, this study aims to explore how men experience and respond to the diagnosis of an illness typically associated with women. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 Israeli men who were diagnosed with breast cancer within the past 10 years. Thematic analysis was performed, focusing on participants’ references to experiencing and managing the psychosocial implications of being a male breast cancer patient. Results: Results demonstrated that participants faced stigmatizing situations both inside and outside healthcare settings. In addition, findings revealed four main responses to stigmatization: (1) selective disclosure, (2) concealment practices, (3) universalizing, and (4) making comparisons. Whereas the first two are strategic reactions to specific situations, the latter two are general conceptual destigmatizing responses. Conclusions: Men's coping styles reveal their efforts to disengage from the discrediting attributes of male breast cancer, to distance themselves from female breast cancer, and to avoid emasculation. They manage stigmatizing situations using disengagement situational responses, such as concealment and selective disclosure, and negotiate group boundaries with the goal of destigmatizing male breast cancer. Beyond broadening the understanding of coping with male breast cancer, this study also illustrates the significant place of boundary work as a destigmatization practice about illness-related stigma. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: Breast cancer in men accounts for approximately 1% of all breast cancers. Breast cancer trials have routinely excluded men. The aim of this analysis was to determine the effect of different treatment factors, in particular, postoperative radiation therapy (RT) on long-term outcomes. Methods and Materials: Seventy-one patients with male breast cancer treated in 5 closely cooperating institutions between 2003 and 2019 were analyzed. Results: Almost all patients (95%) underwent surgical resection. Forty-two patients (59%) received chemotherapy, and 59 (83%) received adjuvant hormonal therapy. Of the 71 patients, 52 (73%) were treated with RT. The rate of recurrence was 20% in the whole cohort, with a locoregional recurrence rate of 3%. In the entire group, the 5-year local control (LC) was 95%, whereas 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) were 62% and 96%, respectively. There was a lower rate of relapses after adjuvant RT (19% vs 32%, P =.05) without in-field relapse after postoperative RT (0%) versus 10% in patients without RT (P =.02). In the multivariate analysis performed, hormonal therapy administration was found to have a possible significant effect on LC and PFS. Administration of adjuvant RT and stage affect PFS. In patients who received RT, there were no grade 3 or 4 acute toxicities. Conclusions: Adjuvant RT is an effective and safe treatment for male breast cancer patients with no infield relapses and better PFS. Hormonal therapy administration was found to have a possible effect on LC and PFS. © 2020 The Author(s)},

The median age was 67.7 years. The average diagnosis delay was 15.7 month. Cancer was discovered through self examination in 76.1% of cases. The mean diameter was 3.5 cm and range from 1-6 cm. According to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification, tumors were classified as T1-T2 (40%) and T3-T4 (60%). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the most frequent (92%) and 1 case of lobular carcinoma. Axillary nodal involvement was present in 82.4% of cases. Hormonal receptors were positive in 83% of cases. 86.6% of our cases present metastasis. Bone was the most representative site. Surgery was usually mastectomy with axillary clearance. It was possible to follow 21 of the patients. The median of follow-up was 12 months. The evolution has been characterized by local recurrence in 6 cases. There was 9 cases of death.

Objective: To describe the sociodemographic data, clinical and paraclinical manifestations, treatment, and recurrence in a sample of patients diagnosed with male breast cancer at a private institution. Methods: Descriptive, retrospective study of an institutional database, in the period 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2020. Demographic, clinical and paraclinical data were collected from the medical records and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: The prevalence of breast cancer in men in the sample was 0.44%, median age 73 years. The most frequent symptom was breast mass (n = 5; 100%), median tumor size 2.5 cm (range 1.6 to 5 cm) and ductal histological type (n = 5; 100%). All 5 cases had hormone receptor expression, without HER2 overexpression; stage was locally advanced in 60% (n = 3) (stage IIB-IIIA / B) and metastatic in one case. Mastectomy was performed in 80% of cases (n = 4). The median follow-up was 23 months and relapse was found in 20% (n = 1), with an average time to relapse of 184 months. Conclusions: In the sample studied, breast cancer in men presented in the seventh decade of life as advanced stage mass, with high hormonal sensitivity. Mastectomy was the main treatment, and most required chemotherapy. © 2021 Peruvian Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology. All Rights Reserved.},

Results: We observed a tendency towards worse OS among male BC patients with lymph node metastases (N+) (5-year OS: 43.5 vs. 73.9%; p = 0.087), a greater tumor size (T4 vs. T1 + T2) (42.0 vs. 70.5%; p = 0.061), and a negative steroid receptor status (PR-) (28.6 vs. 65.6%; p = 0.109). Patients with a family history of cancer had significantly better 5-year OS than patients without a family history of cancer (86.3 vs. 35.0%; p = 0.001). Younger male BC patients (age ≤56 years) had better 5-year OS than patients >56 years of age (82.5 vs. 42.3%; p = 0.028). The 5-year OS was lower among patients with a lower lymphocyte value (≤1.82 × 103) (29.0 vs. 75.6%; p = 0.010). There was a tendency towards worse OS among patients with a higher platelet count (>281 × 103) (4.5-year OS: 16.7 vs. 65.8%; p = 0.056). The 5-year OS was insignificantly lower in the group with NLRs >2.74 than in the group with NLRs ≤2.74 (37.5 vs. 62.8%; p = 0.078). A worse OS rate was associated with an elevated PLR (>169.1) (22.2 vs. 70.1%; p = 0.008). Similarly, there was worse OS in the group with higher MLR (>0.30) (41.8 vs. 78.3%; p = 0.025). Conclusions: The present results reveal that elevated MLRs (>0.30) and PLRs (>169.1) are associated with poor OS among male BC patients. Similarly, but insignificantly, an elevated NLR (>2.74) affected OS.  © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.},

Aim: To understand the characteristics of MBC and its management in Uruguay. Patients & methods: Retrospective observational study that included patients diagnosed with MBC. Results: 22 cases of MBC were found. The median age at diagnosis was 62.5 years. Symptoms included self-detected lump in 17 patients (77.3%) and nipple retraction in seven (22.7%). Ductal carcinomas of histological grade 2-3 were found in 20 patients (90.9%) and stage I-II disease was most commonly encountered (15 patients, 68.1%). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy and tamoxifen were offered to 16 (73%), 12 (54.5%), 17 (65.4%) and 20 (90.9%) patients, respectively. Conclusion: MBC behaves and is treated in many aspects like postmenopausal breast cancer.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To summarize and compare the most recent data from the literature to clarify the management of male breast cancer. METHODS: A review article. RESULTS: Diagnosis and Treatment of Male Breast Cancer have been derivative for years. Nowadays MBC is a noso-logical entity in its own right with biological, molecular and clinical features that require a multidisciplinary approach and the involvement of specific skills. Multimodal treatment involves surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It is evi-dent that the outcome of the MBC is worse than the female one. MBC is often diagnosed in advanced stages. Screening programs in the male population need to be strengthened to obtain an earlier diagnosis. It is necessary to know even more in depth the endocrine-metabolic and behavioral risk factors related to the neoplasm. Finally in the coming years it is reasonable to expect an improvement in multigenic tests: the sensitivity of these methods could predict the risk of recurrence even more precisely. This could lead to substantial changes in the choice and duration of treatment with results that could be surprising. © 2020, Edizioni Luigi Pozzi. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: To describe relevant pathological parameters of Danish male breast cancer patients (MBCP) diagnosed from 1980 to 2009, and to relate these data to treatment, overall survival (OS) and standardized mortality rate (SMR). Materials and methods: The MBCP cohort was defined from national Danish registers. A total of 643 MBCP were identified with tissue available in 457. Among these, 384 were primary operable. Where tissue blocks were available, tumor type, grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesteron receptor (PgR) and androgen-receptor (AR) status as well as HER 2 and Ki67 were performed. OS was quantified by Kaplan–Meier estimates and SMR was calculated based on mortality rate among patients relative to the mortality rate in the general population. Results: Male breast cancer was more often of ductal type, grade II and a very high proportion were ER and AR positive and HER2 negative. Intrinsic subtypes based on immunohistochemical evaluation showed luminal subtype. Ki67 ratio increased over period of study. OS declined by increased age, bigger tumor size, positive lymph node status, higher grade and Luminal B subtype. Hazard ratio and relative risk of SMR were highest for patients aged < 60 years. Conclusion: Male breast cancer is of luminal subtype, but more often Luminal B. Ki67 is crucial in evaluation of subtypes by immunohistochemistry, but have limitations. Subtyping seems to be of major importance. AR also can have a role in future treatment. © 2020, The Author(s).},

However, evidence focusing on male breast cancer is scarce, despite thedifferent clinical characteristics between female and male breast cancer. We aim to estimatehospital length of stay (LOS) and costs associated with male breast cancer in the UnitedStates. Study Design: Retrospective observational study. Methods: We analyzed the 2012-2016 Health Care Utilization Project National InpatientSample of 416 hospitalization events of male patients with breast cancer. Patients who hadbreast cancer diagnoses were selected based on the primary International Classification of Disease , Ninth Revision or Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. A negative binomialregression and a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and log-link functionwere conducted to estimate the LOS and hospital costs after controlling forsociodemographics, clinical characteristics (eg, metastatic status, Elixhauser ComorbidityIndex [ECI] score), and hospital characteristics. Results: On average, male patients with breast cancer stayed for 2.42 days and expensed $9059 per hospital visit. Patients with metastatic status had longer LOS (5.39 vs 3.24 days; P = .005) and higher hospital costs ($11,185 vs $8547; P = .03) than those without. Patientswith an ECI score of 3 or more showed longer LOS (4.05 vs 2.68 days; P = .003) and higherhospital costs ($10,043 vs $7022; P < .001) than those with an ECI score of 0. Conclusions: LOS and hospital costs for male patients with breast cancer were associatedwith metastatic status and comorbidities.

	abstract = {Background: Due to its rarity, few studies have characterized the epidemiology of male breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine survival and risk factors for male breast cancer in a large U.S. population. Methods: In this study, 19,795 male patients with breast cancer were identified from the National Cancer Database (2004–2014). Patient demographics, tumor characteristics and treatments were analyzed by using descriptive statistics. We used multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan Meier analysis. Results: Over 10 years, the incidence of male breast cancer increased from 7.2% to 10.3%, while mortality decreased from 11% to 3.8%. Socioeconomic factors predicting mortality included income medium, and high vs low (HR = 0.78; 0.68), private vs no insurance (HR = 0.73) and the academic research facility vs community cancer center (HR = 0.79). Significant predictors of all-cause mortality included age (HR = 1.04), tumor size (HR = 1.01), hormone receptor expression (HR = 0.8) and cancer stage I vs II, III, and IV at the time of diagnosis (HR = 1.5, 2.7, 4.4, 9.9 respectively). Other predictors of mortality include surgery (HR = 0.4), chemotherapy (HR = 0.8), radiation (HR = 0.8), and hormonal therapy (HR-0.8). Conclusions: Socioeconomic factors, cancer stage, tumor characteristics (size and grade), and high Charlson-Dayo score contributed to higher mortality among male patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Surgery was most effective, followed by radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Patients with positive ER or PR expression demonstrated better survival. Adjusting for socioeconomic factors, biomarker identification and timely, appropriately chosen treatment are likely to reduce the risk for mortality. © 2020},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare tumour in all parts of the world. About 1% of all breast cancers occur in men. Occurrence of male breast cancer peaks at age 71 years. Familial cases usually have BRCA2 rather than BRCA1 mutations. Presentation is usually a lump or nipple inversion, but is often late, with more than 40% of individuals having stage III or IV disease. We retrospectively reviewed 25 male patients with breast cancer who came to the HCG Cancer Centre, Ahmedabad between 2014 and 2018, and their demographic details, tumor profile, and radiological, histopathological as well as luminal profile findings were studied. The average age at presentation and detection of male breast cancer was 61.08 years. Incidence of male ca. breast over these 4 years was 4.75/year which had a significant increase compared with our own data in the last 8 years (3/year). Male to female ratio for ca. breast was 1:61. One out of 25 (4%) patients had gynaecomastia. The most common histology was invasive ductal carcinoma-not otherwise specified with none of the patients having lobular carcinoma. Majority of patients were ER/PR positive and HER-2 negative. Male breast cancer is having a rising incidence, which in our study is 1.56%. Males have relatively older age at presentation and stage-by-stage treatment remains the same. Males are more likely to be having prognostically favourable luminal subtypes. Male breast cancer in Indian population is currently experiencing an increasing trend. Improved awareness amongst patients and high index of suspicion by the clinicians along with accurate diagnostic techniques help detect the disease at an earlier stage culminating into prolonged overall and disease-free survival. © 2019, Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Background. Breast cancer in men is a rare condition, often diagnosed late. The purpose of this study was to describe its epidemiological, histopathological, and radiographic aspects in Togo. Materials and Methods. This was a descriptive retrospective study on cases of breast cancer in humans diagnosed histologically at the Laboratory of Anatomy Pathological and Imagery of the University Hospital in Lomé, over a period of 25 years (1995 to 2019). The parameters studied were epidemiological, anatomopathological, and imaging. Results. Eighty-two (82) cases were diagnosed, an annual frequency of 3.28 cases. The mean age was 45±2.5 years; the range was 27-63 years. The family history of 47 patients (57.32%) was known. Carcinomas represented the predominant histological group with predominantly nonspecific invasive carcinoma (87.5%). These cancers were diagnosed at late stages (75.71% grade II). They were mainly of luminal B profile (38.75%) and associated with mutations of the BRCA2 and BRCA1 genes in 14.63% of the cases. The lesions were classified ACR 5 in 61.5% (11/18). Two cases of breast angiosarcoma were diagnosed by the identification of CD31 markers and factor VIII in immunohistochemistry. Hormone therapy such as tamoxifen was prescribed in all luminal patients (43 patients). Radiotherapy was administered to 15 patients (18.3%), with acute toxicity in 20% of the cases. After a median follow-up of 36 months, the evolution was complete remission in 27 patients (32.93%). Conclusion. Breast cancer in men is rare, often diagnosed late with a poor prognosis. © 2020 Tchin Darre et al.},

	abstract = {In female breast cancer (BC), elastosis is strongly related to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression. Male breast cancers almost invariably express ERα; so, the aim of this study was to investigate elastosis frequency in invasive male BC as well as clinicopathological correlations, in comparison with females. A total of 177 male BC cases and 135 female BC cases were included, all ERα-positive and invasive carcinoma of no special type. Elastosis on H&E-stained slides was scored in a four-tiered system as elastosis grade (EG) 0 (no elastosis) to EG3 (high amount of elastosis). EG scores in male BC were correlated to histopathological characteristics and overall surviva and compared with female BC EG scores. Male BC showed some degree of elastosis in 26/117 cases (22.2%) with none showing EG3, while female BC cases showed elastosis in 89/135 cases (65.9%) with 21.5% showing EG3 (p < 0.001). This difference retained its significance in multivariate logistic regression. In male BC cases, no significant correlations were found between the amount of elastosis and age, grade, mitotic activity index, and PgR. In addition, no significant prognostic value of elastosis was seen. In conclusion, despite high ERα expression, male BC showed significantly less elastosis than female BC. Elastosis did not show clinicopathological correlations or prognostic value. Therefore, elastosis seems to be a less useful ERα tissue biomarker with less clinical significance in male BC compared with females, pointing towards important BC sex differences. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Metastatic pattern (MP) is a prognostic factor in women with breast cancer. However, the prognostic significance of MP in male breast cancer patients remains unknown. Methods: Using the SEER database, we gathered demographic information and disease characteristics for men diagnosed with de novo metastatic breast cancer from 2010 to 2017. Metastases to bone, brain, liver, and lung were used to define MP (bone-only, visceral, bone and visceral [BV], or other). Statistical analyses were performed to identify associations between overall survival (OS) and MP, as well as other patient and tumor features. We used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with sites of metastases. Results: We included 250 patients. MP distribution was bone = 38.8%, visceral = 14.8%, BV = 33.2%, and other = 13.2%. Median OS for each was bone = 33 months, visceral = 23 months, BV = 20 months, and other = 46 months (p = 0.046). Patients with brain metastases had significantly shorter OS compared with no brain metastases (median OS = 9 months vs. 30 months; p < 0.001). Compared with other subtypes, triple negative had the shortest OS (median 9 months, p < 0.001). Logistic regression modeling revealed that compared with HR+/HER2− breast cancers, HR−/HER2+ had higher odds of liver metastases and triple negative had higher odds of brain metastases. Patients younger than 50 years had a significantly greater risk of developing brain metastases. Conclusions: MP and tumor subtype can predict OS outcomes in men with metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis. Brain metastases confer very poor prognosis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To analyze the prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (P/LPVs) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the largest cohort of Slovenian male breast cancer (MBC) patients to date and to explore a possible correlation between the Slovenian founder variant BRCA2:c.7806-2A > G and predisposition to MBC. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 81 MBC cases who underwent genetic counseling and/or testing between January 1999 and May 2020. To explore a possible genotype–phenotype correlation, we performed additional analyses of 203 unrelated families with P/LPVs in BRCA2 and 177 cases of female breast cancer (FBC) in carriers of P/LPVs in BRCA2. Results: Detection rate of P/LPVs in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was 24.7% (20/81) with 95% of them in BRCA2 gene. The only two recurrent P/LPVs were BRCA2:c.7806-2A > G and BRCA2:c.3975_3978dupTGCT (9 and 5 MBC cases, respectively). In families with BRCA2:c.7806-2A > G, the incidence of MBC cases was higher compared to families with other P/LPVs in BRCA2; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (17.8% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.105). BRCA2:c.7806-2A > G was detected in both families with multiple cases of MBC. This splice-site variant represented a significantly higher proportion of all BRCA2 P/LPVs detected in MBC carriers compared to FBC carriers (47.4% vs. 26%, p = 0.049). Conclusion: We observed a high mutation detection rate and conclude this may be due to the prevalent BRCA2:c.7806-2A > G variant in Slovenia. Our results indicate a possible association between this variant and higher risk of breast cancer in males compared to other identified P/LPVs in BRCA2. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Due to its rarity, there are no randomized trials investigating the outcome of adjuvant radiotherapy in MBC. This study reports on patient and tumor characteristics of 41 consecutive MBC patients treated between 1990 and 2018 and on clinical outcomes after surgical resection of tumors and adjuvant radiotherapy of the chest wall or breast. Local control (LC), locoregional control (LRC), overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicity were evaluated. After a median follow-up of 80 months (95% CI: 14.6–213.8 months) there was only one recurrence, in a patient’s locoregional lymph nodes 17 months after start of radiotherapy, resulting in an LC rate of 100% at 5 years and a 5-year LRC rate of 97.4% (standard deviation (SD): 0.025). Five-year DFS and OS rates were 64.6% (SD: 0.085) and 57.2% (SD: 0.082), respectively. Adjuvant radiotherapy was tolerated well without high-grade (CTCAE grade > II) adverse events. After tumor resection and adjuvant radiotherapy, LC and LRC rates in MBC patients are excellent and comparable to results found for female breast cancer (FBC) patients. However, as patients are often diagnosed with locally advanced, higher-risk tumors, distant recurrences remain the major failure pattern. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Male breast cancer is an uncommon disease. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of male breast cancer patients has not been determined. The aim of this study was to explore the value of adjuvant chemotherapy in men with stage I–III breast cancer, and we hypothesized that some male patients may safely skip adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: Male breast cancer patients between 2010 and 2015 from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database were included. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were used to analyse the factors associated with survival. The propensity score matching method was adopted to balance baseline characteristics. Kaplan–Meier curves were used to evaluate the impacts of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival. The primary endpoint was survival. Results: We enrolled 514 patients for this study, including 257 patients treated with chemotherapy and 257 patients without. There was a significant difference in overall survival (OS) but not in breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) between the two groups (p < 0.001 for OS and p = 0.128 for BCSS, respectively). Compared with the non-chemotherapy group, the chemotherapy group had a higher 4-year OS rate (97.5% versus 95.2%, p < 0.001), while 4-year BCSS was similar (98% versus 98.8%, p = 0.128). The chemotherapy group had longer OS than the non-chemotherapy group among HR+, HER2–, tumour size >2 cm, lymph node-positive male breast cancer patients (p < 0.05). Regardless of tumour size, there were no differences in OS or BCSS between the chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy cohorts for lymph node-negative patients (OS: p > 0.05, BCSS: p > 0.05). Adjuvant chemotherapy showed no signiﬁcant effects on both OS and BCSS in patients with stage I (OS: p = 0.100, BCSS: p = 0.858) and stage IIA breast cancer (OS: p > 0.05, BCSS: p > 0.05). Conclusion: For stage I and stage IIA patients, adjuvant chemotherapy could not improve OS and BCSS. Therefore, adjuvant chemotherapy might be skipped for stage I and stage IIA male breast cancer patients. © The Author(s), 2020.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer is a rare disease, accounting for 0,1% of all cancers in men and for 0.6% to 1% of all breast cancers. The aim of this paper is to present histopathological and clinical features of male breast cancer at the Clinic for Surgery, Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, Croatia, over the 14-year period. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2017 twenty-seven men underwent surgery for breast cancer at our facility. Information retreived from the patients' records included the stage of the disease, histologic type, histologic grade, hormone receptor status of the primary tumour, and the axillary lymph node status. RESULTS: The majority of patients presented with advanced stages of the disease (stages III and IV). Grade 2 was the most frequent histologic grade. Invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type was the most common histologic type. Hormone receptor status was positive in most of the cases. Approximately half of the patients had positive axillary lymh nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to successful treatment of male breast cancer. Due to positive hormone receptors in most of the patients with advanced stages of male breast cancer, hormonal therapy played a critical role. Further research on larger samples will be necessary for developing new methods for diagnosing and treating breast cancer in men. Copyright © 2019 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast-cancer (MBC) is often diagnosed late. Our purpose was to evaluate fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) versus Tru-Cut biopsy (TCNB) in MBC diagnosis. Patients and Methods: Men with suspicious breast lesions were prospectively enrolled; 54 met the inclusion criteria and underwent FNAC and TCNB. FNAC, TCNB and gold-standard results were compared. Results: Unsatisfactory results were 11.1% after FNAC and none after TCNB (p=0.027). After gold-standard evaluation, the diagnosis of FNAC and TCNB was confirmed, respectively, in 63.0% and 98.1% and changed in 37.0% and 1.9% (p<0.001). The malignancy rate after FNAC, TCNB and surgery were, respectively, 25.9%, 33.3% and 35.1% (FNAC vs. TCNB p=0.5276, FNAC vs. surgery p=0.404; TCNB vs. surgery p=1). Among invasive carcinomas, 93.8% were identified by FNAC vs. 87.5% by TCNB (p=1); all ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were detected after TCNB and none after FNAC (p=0.1). Conclusion: FNAC leads to a significantly higher number of inadequate samplings and seems to be subject to increased DCIS misdiagnoses. TCNB correlated better to the final histological report. © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research. All rights reserved.},

Given the absence of ad hoc prospective randomized clinical trials, treatment strategies are based on extrapolation from female breast cancer recommendations or solely on population-based data. Areas covered: This review discusses the current treatment landscape for male breast cancer in the adjuvant and in the metastatic setting. The authors also discuss the biology and genomic landscape of male breast cancer. Original research and review articles, relative to the period 2010–2019, were included in the review of the literature. Expert opinion: There is a major medical need to include male patients with breast cancer in prospective clinical trials. The call to equality in breast cancer care can be pursued via two divergent paths: (i) a gender-neutral delivery of breast cancer information and (ii) the creation of separate sections, for the more common female breast cancer and for the rare male ones. We propose to differentiate male breast cancer care, acknowledging unique onco-sexual and social needs that can be only partially shared. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Male breast cancer is uncommon, delay in seeking medical attention often results in late presentation and poor prognosis. Methods: Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed. Patients who were still having regular follow-up were contacted for telephone interview. Results: In this study, 56 male breast cancer patients were treated in our center from January 1998 to December 2018, accounting for 0.88% of all breast cancers treated during the same period of time. Median age of onset was 61 years old (Range: 33-95). In this study, 6 (10.7%) patients presented with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis and received palliative systemic treatment only. And, 50 patients were surgically treated and all had mastectomy. Axillary dissection was performed in 36 (72%) patients, while sentinel node biopsy was performed in 14 (28%) patients. Median tumor size was 23 mm (2-100 mm). A Majority were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma (NOS), while 38 (67.8%) patients were node positive.Here 36 (64.3%) patients were alive at the time of the study, 31 (86.1%) patients responded to the telephone interview. More than 90% of our patients expressed various degrees of embarrassment at the time of breast symptom onset. Similarly, more than 90% of these patients experienced embarrassment while waiting in the breast center with predominant female patients. Most patients (N = 26) were not aware that breast cancer can occur in men prior to the diagnosis. Median duration from symptoms to the first medical consultation was 12.4 months (1-120 months). Conclusion: Male breast cancer is rare and patients usually present late, Lack of knowledge, public education, and embarrassment are the important related factors. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Objectives Recent trends in male breast cancer have been inadequately studied. We updated mortality trends in selected countries and regions worldwide using most recent available data and we predicted figures for 2020. Methods We extracted official death certification data for male breast cancer and population estimates from the WHO and the Pan American Health Organization databases, from 2000 to 2017. We computed age-standardized (world population) death rates for selected countries and regions worldwide. We used joinpoint regression analysis to identify significant changes in trends and to predict death numbers and rates for 2020. Results In 2015-2017, Central-Eastern Europe had a rate of 2.85/1 000 000, and Russia of 2.22, ranking among the highest. North-Western and Southern Europe, the European Union as a whole and the USA showed rates ranging between 1.5 and 2.0. Lower rates were observed in most Latin American countries, with values below 1.35/1 000 000, in Australia, 1.22, and Japan, 0.58. Between 2000-2004 and 2015-2017, age-adjusted death rates decreased between 10 and 40% in North-Western Europe, Russia, and the USA, and between 1.5 and 25% in the other areas under study, except Latin America (+0.8%). Except for Central-Eastern Europe, predicted rates for 2020 were favourable. Conclusion Advancements in management are likely the main drivers of the favourable trends in male breast cancer death rates over the last decades. Delayed diagnosis and limited access to effective care explain the higher mortality in some areas. Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast carcinoma (male BC) is an uncommon neoplasia without individualized strategies for diagnosis and therapeutics. Low overall survival (OS) rates have been reported, mostly associated with patients’ advanced stage and older age. Intratumoral heterogeneity versus homogeneity of malignant epithelial cells seems to be an important factor to consider for the development of combination therapies with curative intention. Objective: In this preliminary study, we aim to provide valuable insight into the distinct clinicopathologic features of male BC. Material and methods: In a series of 40 male BC patients, we evaluated by immunohistochemistry androgen receptor; activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3); p16; cyclin D1; fatty acid synthase (FASN); fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1); β1, β3, β4, and β6 integrins; collagen I and collagen IV; and their interactions. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were assessed for statistical analysis. Results: Homogeneous epithelial staining of p16, ATF3, β6 integrin, FASN, and FATP1 was found to be significantly intercorrelated, and associated with high Ki67. These markers also stained tumor stromal fibroblasts. The prognostic analysis showed statistically significant associations of FASN with disease-free survival (DFS) and OS, as well as of ATF3 with OS and collagen IV with DFS. Conclusions: This study highlights, as a novel finding, the relevance of FASN, ATF3, and collagen IV immunophenotypes, which may have innovative application in the clinical management of male BC. © The Author(s) 2021.},

The aim of this study was to explore the health care situation of MBCPs from their perspectives. Methods: The study follows a mixed-methods design, combining quantitative data from a standardized written questionnaire with qualitative data from personal interviews. Descriptive statistics (quantitative data) and qualitative content analysis (qualitative data) were used for data analysis. Results: Questionnaires completed by 100 and personal interviews of 27 MBCPs were analyzed. Several men reported mainly positive experiences while others experienced shortcomings. These included delays in diagnosis, health care provider uncertainty about treatment (tamoxifen, radiation therapy), experiences of stigmatization, and issues of continuity of care including unclear responsibilities for aftercare and access challenges to breast-cancer-specific care in gynecology settings. Conclusions: The awareness of male breast cancer needs to be increased among the public, health care providers and researchers in order to avoid delays in diagnosis and reduce stigmatization and uncertainty about treatment. Health care structures ensuring access to gynecology care and clear responsibilities for aftercare need to be established. © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.},

Objectives: The aim of this study is to explore the experiences of men living with breast cancer and to identify supportive care needs. Methods: Eighteen men were interviewed using qualitative, semi-structured telephone interviews. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The majority of men did not have negative feelings about having a "women's disease," although some felt that stigmatization threatened their masculinity. Male sex was perceived as hindering access to adequate care. Patients identified key barriers including (1) a lack of awareness and experience of treating males among health professionals; (2) treatment and available information were based on evidence for females; and (3) lacking support services. Conclusion: To improve MBC care, it is important to raise awareness of the disease and to adapt treatment strategies, patient information, and support services to meet the needs of men. © 2019 S.

	abstract = {Objective: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, both in Brazil and worldwide. Breast cancer can also affects men but this constitutes only 1% of cases and is thus considered rare, and for this reason is little studied. Statistics indicate an increase in its incidence with an estimate of new cases in recent years. This study aims to analyze the knowledge of higher education students in relation to breast cancer in men. the knowledge of higher education students in relation to breast cancer in men. Materials and Methods: exploratory study with a quantitative approach. 299 male students participated in the study. Data collection took place through semi-structured questionnaires, completed by students from pure science, human sciences and health at a higher education institution. Results: Regardless of the area of undergraduate study, 65.9% of the volunteers reported not knowing about breast cancer in men. Regarding predisposing factors for the development of breast cancer, 77.3% reported not knowing about these while 68.9% reported not knowing about breast self-examination. However, 67.6% believe that breast cancer in men can be prevented. Worryingly, 62.5% reported that they only seek medical assistance when becoming ill. Conclusion: Evidence from this study suggests that higher level undergraduates have limited knowledge about breast cancer in men. Only one third knew that male breast cancer was possible. Even smaller proportions knew of the predisposing factors for breast cancer, how to perform self-examination and about diagnosis. These latter factors, when combined with a tendency to seek medical help only when ill, suggests a short-fall in health knowledge which should be corrected. ©Copyright 2021 by the the Turkish Federation of Breast Diseases Societies.},

Treatment recommendations are mostly extrapolated from evidence in female breast cancer (FBC). Data show that MBC has unique clinical and biological characteristics distinct from FBC. Evidence from retrospective studies suggests that effective therapeutic interventions are often underutilized in MBC and this can compromise outcomes. Population based studies contribute significantly towards the understanding of rare cancers. Multiple studies have demonstrated that adjuvant radiation is associated with improved local control and survival in high risk subgroups of MBC. Multi-center consortia studies contribute significantly towards generating prospective data and optimizing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in these rare cancers.

Because clinical trials are rare, the synthesis of real-world data is one method of integrating sufficient evidence on the optimal treatment for this patient population. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Clinical studies were included if they evaluated the treatments of interest in male breast cancer; these evaluations included breast-conserving surgery (BCS) versus mastectomy, postmastectomy radiation therapy versus no radiation, the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and a comparison of various endocrine therapies. Results: Forty studies were retrieved. The pooled estimate of overall survival (OS) revealed no difference between BCS and mastectomy groups. Postmastectomy radiation to the chest wall significantly increased OS relative to no postmastectomy radiation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.54 to 0.84). The pooled estimates of identification and false-negative rates of SLNB were 97.4 and 7.4 per cent respectively. Tamoxifen treatment was associated with significantly increased OS compared with no tamoxifen intake (HR 0.62, 0.41 to 0.95). Conclusion: Identification and false-negative rates for SLNB were comparable to those in female breast cancer. Breast-conserving surgery can be effective and safe; postmastectomy radiation to the chest wall and 5-year tamoxifen treatment improves survival.  © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The surgical guidelines for male breast cancer (MBC) have been largely guided by female-predominant clinical trials. Because no clinical trial has been conducted to examine the surgical treatment of MBC, we performed a systematic review comparing the survival of patients with MBC who had undergone breast conserving surgery (BCS) and those who had undergone mastectomy and evaluated the patients’ radiotherapy compliance after BCS. We performed a systematic search of electronic databases to find MBC cohort studies that had reported ≥ 1 survival outcome (disease-free survival [DFS], disease-specific survival [DSS], or overall survival [OS]) stratified by surgical treatment (BCS and/or mastectomy) and/or radiotherapy compliance with BCS. A total of 1 prospective and 9 retrospective cohort studies were included, with the number of patients ranging from 7 to 6039. Of the BCS patients, compliance with postoperative radiotherapy was low (range, 27%-46%), with the exception of 1 single-institution prospective study that reported 86% compliance (6 of 7 patients). The pooled estimate for all patients with MBC was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78%-88%) for 5-year DSS and 66% (95% CI, 63%-70%) for 5-year OS. Most studies reported no differences in DFS, DSS, or OS for BCS and mastectomy. BCS is a reasonable treatment approach for MBC because it was associated with oncologic outcomes similar to those with mastectomy. However, the low rates of radiotherapy compliance among male patients who underwent BCS is concerning and highlights the importance of shared decision-making with patients with MBC when selecting a surgical treatment strategy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Androgen Receptor (AR) positivity is often displayed in breast cancer and especially in Male Breast Cancer (MBC), where it appears to be a heterogeneous feature, with its expression ranging between 38 and 81% of cases. Given the fact that circulating androgens represent the most important sex hormones in males and that breast carcinogenesis is characteristically subjected to hormonal mechanisms, our purpose was to investigate the clinicopathological significance of AR in MBC assessing if its expression could be associated with parameters of tumor aggressiveness. Methods: Clinical and pathological data were retrospectively reviewed for male patients with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. AR status was detected by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumoral tissue sections. Correlations between AR expression and histopathological features were assessed using univariate and multiple comparisons where appropriate, assuming P values < 0.05 as statistically significant. Results: The study included 44 consecutive male patients. AR expression ranged between 10 and 98% and the majority of cases presented a moderate to high expression of this receptor. Adopting a 20% PgR cut-off, statistical analyses highlighted a different behavior of AR: in ER+/PgRhigh group, it positively correlated with the other steroid receptors pointing out the importance of hormonal cross-talk: in ER+/PgRlow group, AR status inversely correlated with histological grade and lymph node status. Conclusion: Hormonal factors reveal to play a crucial role in MBC carcinogenesis and progression. Intriguingly, in ER+/PgRlow tumors AR expression significantly correlates with lymph node status, hinting at a favorable biological role of AR in this tumor subgroup. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rather uncommon and understudied disease. It accounts for less than 1% of all breast cancers, but in recent decades its frequency has been on the rise. Clinical trials of breast cancer have traditionally excluded men. Due to the lack of large-scale prospective studies, most published data come from single-institution, small-cohort studies, and treatment recommendations are based on the extrapolation of data from clinical trials enrolling only women. Although to some extent etiology, diagnosis, and treatment characteristics can be similar, male breast cancer exhibits some distinct features. Men tend to be diagnosed with breast cancer at an older age and at a more advanced stage. A better understanding of the biologic features, clinically relevant differences, effective treatments, and outcomes of male breast cancer is crucial to appropriately manage these patients. We present a male breast cancer case with a germline BRCA2 mutation and discuss the epidemiologic, pathologic, and clinical characteristics along with treatment and follow-up recommendations in view of our recent understanding of this disease. © 2021 UBM Medica Healthcare Publications.

	abstract = {Introduction: Male breast cancer (MBC) incidence is <1%, but it is increasing. MBC incidence increases with age. There are no randomized trials on MBC because of low number of patients seen in any institution and hence its management is derived from breast cancer (BC) in women. In this study, we analyzed outcome in MBC patients with adjuvant treatment. Materials and Methods: From 1991 to 2014, 81 men with BC were retrospectively analyzed for demographic, clinicopathological, and treatment outcomes. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as time duration from diagnosis to first recurrence. Overall survival (OS) was defined as time duration from pathologic diagnosis to death or last follow-up with any death defined as an event. DFS and OS were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared between patients receiving and not receiving adjuvant treatment using log-rank test. Results: The median age was 57 years (range 30-86 years). Right, left, and bilateral BCs were seen in 41 (51%), 38 (47%), and 2 (2%) men, respectively. The mean duration of symptoms was 25 months (range 1-240 months). Comorbidity and family history was present in 31 (38%) and 3 (4%) men, respectively. The mean tumor size was 5 cm × 5 cm (range, 1 cm × 1 cm to 10 cm × 10 cm). Nipple was involved in 46 (57%) men. Early, locally advanced, and metastatic disease were seen in 30 (37%), 34 (42%), and 17 (21%) men, respectively. Majority (71, 88%) of men had invasive ductal carcinoma histology. In radically treated 64 men, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given to 12 (19%) patients (fluorouracil, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide [FAC] to 9 and FAC + taxanes to 3), with CR in 4 (33.3%) and partial response (PR) in 8 (66.7%) patients. Mastectomy was done in 55 (86%) and wide local excision in 9 (14%) men. Margins and nodes were positive in 17 (27%) and 38 (59%) men, respectively. Estrogen receptor, PR, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu positive were seen in 27 (42%), 17 (26.5%), and 2 (3%) patients, respectively. Adjuvant hypofractionated radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and tamoxifen were received by 51 (80%), 35 (55%), and 45 (70%) men, respectively. Median follow-up was 60 months (range 4-278 months). Locoregional recurrence occurred in 8 (12.5%) and distant metastasis in 22 (34%) men, respectively. DFS and OS at 10 years were 42% and 53%, respectively. DFS and OS were significantly better in men with adjuvant radiation (54% vs. 24%, P = 0.007 and 57% vs. 35%, P = 0.022, respectively) and hormonal therapy (57% vs. 14.5%, P = 0.004 and 62% vs. 39%, P = 0.045, respectively). Chemotherapy had no impact on DFS and OS. Conclusion: Adjuvant hypofractionated radiotherapy and hormonal therapy significantly improved DFS and OS in MBC patients. Chemotherapy had no impact on DFS and OS. © 2020 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

	abstract = {Objective: The primary objective of this study was to delineate differences in management, overall and distant disease-free survival in males diagnosed with breast cancer and treated at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center as compared to comprehensively matched female subjects. Secondary objectives included assessment of clinical and histopathologic features and recurrence score, as measured by Oncotype DX and the modified Magee equation #2. Materials and Methods: This single institution retrospective study compared male and comprehensively matched female patients (1:2) with stage I-III breast cancer between 1994 and 2014. Recurrence risk was estimated using a modified Magee equation. Overall survival and distant disease-free survival were estimated and compared using Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank methods. Results: Forty-five male breast cancer patients were included (stage I: 26.7%; stage II: 53.3%; stage III: 20.0%; hormone receptor positive: 97.8%; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative: 84.4%) with a median age of 63.8 (43.0-79.4) years at diagnosis. Intermediate and low recurrence scores were most common in male and female patients respectively; mean score was similar between groups (20.3 vs. 19.8). The proportion of male breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and post-mastectomy radiation was lower compared to female patients (42.2% vs. 65.3%, p=0.013; 22.7% vs. 44.4%, p=0.030, respectively). Overall survival and distant disease-free survival between male and female patients were similar. Conclusion: Male breast cancer patient outcomes were similar compared to well-matched female patients suggesting that breast cancer specific factors are more prognostic than gender. © Galenos Publishing House.

	abstract = {Background: Androgen receptor (AR) has been described to play a prominent role in male breast cancer (MBC). It maps on chromosome X, and recent reports indicate that X-chromosome polysomy is frequent in MBC. Since the response to anti-androgen therapy may depend on AR polysomy and on its overexpression similarly to prostate cancer, the aim of the present study was to investigate the DNA methylation level of AR and its coregulators, especially those mapped on the X-chromosome, that may influence the activity of AR in MBC. Methods: The DNA methylation level of AR, MAGEA2, MAGEA11, MAGEC1, MAGEC2, FLNA, HDAC6, and UXT, mapped on the X-chromosome, was evaluated by quantitative bisulfite-NGS. Bioinformatic analysis was performed in a Galaxy Project environment using BWA-METH, MethylDackel, and Methylation Plotter tools. The study population consisted of MBC (41 cases) compared with gynecomastia (17 cases). Results: MAGEA family members, especially MAGEA2, MAGEA11, MAGEC, and UXT and HDAC6 showed hypomethylation of several CpGs, reaching statistical significance by the Kruskal–Wallis test (p < 0.01) in MBC when compared to gynecomastia. AR showed almost no methylation at all. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated for the first time that MAGEA family members mapped on the X-chromosome and coregulators of AR are hypomethylated in MBC. This may lead to their overexpression, enhancing AR activity. © Copyright © 2020 Foschini, Morandi, Sanchez, Santoro, Mulè, Zannoni, Varga, Moskovszky, Cucchi, Moelans, Giove, van Diest and Masetti.},

	abstract = {Similar to prostate cancer, male breast cancer (MBC) is a hormone-responsive neoplasm. Opposite to prostate cancer, MBC is extremely rare, with MBC cases accounting for 1% of all newly diagnosed malignancies and an incidence of approximately 1 in 100,000 men [1]. Importantly, temporal trends analysis performed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data show a 40% rise in incidence since 1975 compared with 2015 [1]. Despite the challenges posed by the rarity of this condition, multiple risk factors have been identified. Older age is a prominent risk factor, with an incidence in men 50 years old of 0.2 per 100,000, which climbs up to 6.3 per 100,000 in those 65 years old [2]. In an analysis of the prospective National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study that involved approximately 325 thousands men including 121 with a MBC diagnosis, an approximately doubled increased risk of MBC was reported in males with a first-degree relative who had been diagnosed with breast cancer (relative risk [RR]: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.19a3.09) [3]. Of note, men who had reported a bone fracture were also at increased risk of MBC (RR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.24a3.91), similarly to obese and inactive men [3]. A more comprehensive research conducted by analyzing a cohort of 4,501,578 men aged 18a100 years that included 642 men with primaryMBC found that a number of conditions including obesity (1.98, 1.55a2.54), diabetes (RR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.05a1.60), orchitis/epididymitis (1.84, 1.10a3.08), Klinefelter syndrome (29.64, 12.26a71.68) and gynecomastia (5.86, 3.74a9.17), were associated with MBC at univariate analysis. Among these, association ofMBC with Klinefelter syndrome (16.83, 6.81a41.62), gynecomastia (5.08, 3.21a8.03), obesity (1.91, 1.50a2.44) and orchitis/epididymitis (1.80, 1.08a3.01) was also confirmed at multivariate analysis [4]. Exposure to radiation can also increase the risk of MBC, as shown by a caseacontrol study that collected information regarding exposure to ionizing radiation in 227 cases and 300 controls and found an increased risk in men with 3 chest x rays and in those men who had received radiotherapy to the chest [5]. Finally, some genetic alterations may also play an important role as risk factors of MBC. In a retrospective case series of 27 MBC patients with available genetic test results, nine (33.3%) had a breast cancer gene (BRCA) 1 or 2 mutation [6]. In fact, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with MBC is 1a5% for individuals carrying a BRCA1 alteration and 5a10% for those with a BRCA2 alteratoin, which is 10a100-times the risk estimated in the general population [7]. Mastectomy, with or without radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, represents the mainstay of treatment of MBC [8]. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) is a highly debated option in breast cancer survivors, although it remains uncertain whether its benefits in terms of overall and cancer-free survival outweigh its cost and disadvantages [9]. Currently, presence of a BRCA mutation represents the strongest indication for CPM in both females and males. In a cross-sectional survey involving 1226 physicians among medical and radiation oncologists as well as plastic and general surgeons, 92% of participants recommended CPM in those with a mutated BRCA gene [10]. While indication for CPM in presence of a BRCA mutation is established, MBC patients who are at an aaveragea™ risk of recurrence face the dilemma of undergoing CPM or not. In this regard, a significant tool has been recently made available by Li et al. who developed and published a nomogram capable of estimating the risk of contralateral breast cancer in male patients [11]. The researchers retrospectively analyzed the medical information of 4405 MBC patients treated with unilateral mastectomy or CPM from 1998 to 2015 retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. The proposed nomogram was constructed to estimate the 3-, 5- and 8-year probabilities of breast cancer-specific death. The study cohort comprised 4197 patients treated with unilateral mastectomy and 208 patients treated with CPM, who were followed-up for a median of 63-months median follow-up. The authors found that the simultaneous evaluation of xi parameters including CPM, marital status, T-stage, N-stage, histology and tumor grade allowed the prediction of the pre-established outcomes with a C-index 0.75 (95% CI: 0.73a0.77) in the training cohort and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.71a0.74) in the internal validation group [11]. In this Editorial, we have reviewed useful evidence to underline the potential role of CPM in patients with MBC and the uncertainties of the associated benefits, which generates a challenging situation for both the patient and the physician. While evaluation of known risk factors, such as presence of BRCA mutation or any of the other conditions reviewed above, is surely important, the possibility of providing the exact expected increase in the chances of survival associated with CPM is of great value in the context of common clinical practice. In practical terms, we propose that in men with a BRCA mutation, CPM should always be discussed with the patient, with benefits outweighing risks in the majority of cases. In those who do not harbor a BRCA mutation, the use of the cited nomogram appears to provide valuable information to be discussed with the patient on an individual basis. For instance, in a patient with a risk of breast cancer death at 8 years of 30%,CPMcan yield a considerable risk reduction in absolute terms (= 10%), which becomes trivial in men who have a risk of 5% without CPM because of the favorable characteristics of the disease. Randomized Phase III trials are required, specifically designed to randomize men who have completed the standard course of treatment for breast cancer, to CPM versus observation. Men with wild-type BRCA and men with an estimated risk of breast cancer-related death at 5 years = 20% could be included. Although a large sample size would be needed, which may be accomplished only with an international effort, such a trial would represent a unique opportunity to establish the optimal indication for CPM.  © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Background: The incidence of male breast cancer (MBC), although rare, has shown an increase. However, the current epidemiology of and practice patterns for MBC remain unclear. This study evaluated the characteristics and care patterns for MBC compared with female breast cancer (FBC) in Japan. Methods: Using the National Database of Hospital-Based Cancer Registries (HBCR) linked to the Diagnosis Procedure Combination data, we analyzed newly diagnosed breast cancer cases between January 2012 and December 2015 at participating hospitals in a large quality-of-care monitoring project. We employed logistic regression models to assess cancer treatment differences between MBC and FBC in patients who were indicated for adjuvant radiation therapy and neo-adjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy. Results: Of 142,636 breast cancer patients, 870 (0.61%) were MBC patients. At diagnosis, the mean age of MBC patients was 10 years older than FBC patients (70 vs 60 years; P <.001). Advanced-stage cancer was more frequently observed in MBC than in FBC (stage III/IV 18.9%/6.1% vs 10.6%/5.2%). Despite this, MBC patients were less likely to receive adjuvant radiation therapy and neo-adjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy. Gender was an independent treatment determinant factor for chemotherapy decisions. Conclusion: MBC patients were older and had higher stages of cancer than FBC patients at diagnosis, but received suboptimal treatment. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is an uncommon (rare) disease in men, approximately 1% of the total breast cancer cases in the world. By reason of the rare occurrence, there is no clinical or hospital study giving the information about the essential trace and toxic elements in the biological samples of male breast cancer patients. Methods: The aim of current study was to estimate association among essential trace {zinc (Zn), iron (Fe) and copper (Cu)} and toxic {cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb)} elements in human biological samples particularly blood, serum, scalp hair, of male breast cancer patients (n = 14, age range 52 - 58 years) residents of Hyderabad, Pakistan. For comparative purposes, the biological samples of referent persons (n = 37) of the same age groups were also be analyzed. Microwave oven mediated digestion method was employed, and digestion of samples was carried out with the help of 2:1 mixture solution of HNO3 (65%) and H2O2 (30%). Atomic absorption spectrometry was employed for the determination of elemental concentrations from the microwave oven employed digested samples. Results: The found average of essential elements (zinc, iron, and copper) in samples of male breast cancer patients was found to be lower, while cadmium and nickel were found to be higher, when compared with samples from referents (p < 0.001). Conclusions: These data will be helpful for treatment of male breast cancer patients to improve his health and life. © 2021 Verlag Klinisches Labor GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for 1% of all breast cancers and there is a paucity of data on factors impacting the treatment strategies and outcomes. We sought to use a large national database to examine trends and predictors of the use of adjuvant radiation (Adj-RT), as well as any association with outcome. Methods: We queried the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for patients with stages I-III MBC treated with surgery (breast conservation surgery-BCS or mastectomy-MS) within 180 days of diagnosis (years 2004–2015). Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of adj-RT receipt. Multivariable Cox regression evaluated predictors of survival. Propensity matching for adj-RT was used to account for indication biases. Results: We identified 6,217 patients meeting the eligibility criteria (1457 BCS vs. 4760 MS). The majority of patients were Caucasian (85%) and in an age range of 50–80 years (74%). Although adj-RT was omitted for 30% of BCS patients, the utilization was higher compared to MS (OR=26, p-value=0.001). The predictors of adj-RT use included African-American race, more advanced stage, higher grade, presence of lymphovascular invasion, and ER/Her-2 positivity for the entire cohort and increased age, urban location and higher income for BCS. Adj-RT was associated with lower mortality in the propensity matched model (overall HR for BCS=0.28, p-value<0.001; overall HR for MS=0.62, p-value=0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that while adj-RT after BCS is associated with decreased mortality in MBC patients, adj-RT is omitted in up to a third of cases of MBC after BCS despite being standard of care. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Purpose: Breast cancer (BC) in males accounts for <0.5% of all male cancer diagnoses and ~1% of all BCs in the United States. We sought to describe clinicopathologic characteristics among male and female BC patients and differences in overall survival (OS) through the National Cancer Database over 13 years (2004-2016). Materials and Methods: Secondary to the 1:99 ratio of male to female BC cases, we randomly selected female cases for equal comparison to males cases by diagnosis year. Chi-square and t-tests compared demographic and tumor characteristics. OS was examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results: Among the ~2.7 million BC patients, 9 per 1,000 BCs were in males, the rate remained similar over time. The mean (SD) age was 64.9±13.0 years for males and 60.7±13.6 years for females. Most of the male BC cases were white (non-Hispanic) (n=19,015 [80.2%]), clinical stage I (n=7,353 [32.1%]) or stage II disease (n=7,923 [34.6%]), and tumors were moderate or poorly differentiated (84.5%). Males exhibited more comorbidities, presented with a larger proportion of disease, and decreased OS (p<0.005) than females. Male OS was >10% lower at 5-years and nearly 20% lower at 10-years for males. More males had primary BC tumors under the nipple; the 10-year OS rate for this site was 48.8%. Conclusions: This study reports clinicopathologic characteristics of a large cohort of male BC. Males present at older age, with a greater comorbidity index, at later stages of disease. Increased education regarding the continued risks of male breast cancer may be warranted. © 2020 CABI International. All rights reserved.},

We analyzed an Australian dataset of patients with early breast cancer (including ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS) for demographic, pathological and treatment information. The primary objective was to compare treatment delivery for males versus females. Methods: Australian data from the BreastSurgANZ Quality Audit (BQA) from 1 October 2006 and 30 September 2016 were analyzed. Demographic and pathological information was obtained and compared between males and females. Treatment recommendations were compared to BreastSurgANZ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines to assess for adherence to national and international guidelines, respectively. Results: A total of 99,768 breast cancer episodes were analyzed, comprising 585 males (544 invasive; 41 DCIS) and 99 183 (99.4%) females (85 596 invasive; 13 525 DCIS; 62 unknown). Compared with females, males were older at diagnosis, more likely to be hormone receptor-positive and lymph node-positive disease, and more likely to have mastectomy. The proportion of males undergoing breast conserving surgery receiving radiotherapy was the only BreastSurgANZ KPI that was not met. Males were less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy than females using NCCN guidelines. Conclusion: Australian males with breast cancer account for 0.6% of breast cancer incidence and have similar clinico-pathological features as reported internationally. Overall, there is good compliance with the surgical KPIs, and adherence to NCCN guidelines for adjuvant systemic treatment is similar to previous international studies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare tumor, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancers. In MBC, genetic predisposition plays an important role; however, only a few studies have investigated in depth the role of genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2. We performed a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis with a panel of 94 cancer predisposition genes on germline DNA from an Italian case series of 70 patients with MBC. Moreover, we searched for large deletions/duplications of BRCA1/2 genes through the Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) technique. Through the combination of NGS and MLPA, we identified three pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 gene and six in the BRCA2 gene. Besides these alterations, we found six additional pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variants in PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, RAD51C, BAP1 and EGFR genes. From our study, BRCA1 and BRCA2 emerge as the main genes associated with MBC risk, but also other genes seem to be associated with the disease. Indeed, some of these genes have already been implicated in female breast cancer predisposition, but others are known to be involved in other types of cancer. Consequently, our results suggest that novel genes could be involved in MBC susceptibility, shedding new light on their role in cancer development. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In total, ~25% of familial breast cancer (BC) is attributed to germline mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, while the rest of the cases are included in the BRCAX group. BC is also known to affect men, with a worldwide incidence of 1%. Epigenetic alterations, including DNA meth- ylation, have been rarely studied in male breast cancer (MBC) on a genome-wide level. The aim of the present study was to examine the global DNA methylation profiles of patients with BC to identify differences between familial female breast cancer (FBC) and MBC, and according to BRCA1, BRCA2 or BRCAX mutation status. The genomic DNA of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 17 women and 7 men with BC was subjected to methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and hybridized on human promoter microarrays. The comparison between FBC and MBC revealed 2,846 significant differen- tially methylated regions corresponding to 2,486 annotated genes. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed molecular function terms, such as the GTPase superfamily genes (particularly the GTPase Rho GAP/GEF and GTPase RAB), and cellular component terms associated with cytoskeletal architecture, such as 'cytoskeletal part', 'keratin filament' and 'intermediate filament'. When only FBC was considered, several cancer-associated pathways were among the most enriched KEGG pathways of differentially methylated genes when the BRCA2 group was compared with the BRCAX or BRCA1+BRCAX groups. The comparison between the BRCA1 and BRCA2+BRCAX groups comprised the molecular function term 'cytoskeletal protein binding'. Finally, the func- tional annotation of differentially methylated genes between the BRCAX and BRCA1+BRCA2 groups indicated that the most enriched molecular function terms were associated with GTPase activity. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to compare the global DNA methylation profile of familial FBC and MBC. The results may provide useful insights into the epigenomic subtyping of BC and shed light on a possible novel molecular mechanism underlying BC carcinogenesis. © 2021 Spandidos Publications.

	abstract = {Purpose: Breast cancer is a major public health concern worldwide and shows significant heterogeneity between male and female. Knowing the global incidence landscape in both sexes is critical for the breast cancer prevention and the reduction in disease burden. Methods: We retrieved the incidence data of breast cancer in both sexes from the Global Burden of Disease 2017 database. Average annual percentage change was used to quantify the temporal trends of breast cancer incidence. Results: Between 1990 and 2017, the number of newly diagnosed female breast cancer (FBC) cases increased from 870.2 thousand to 1937.6 thousand, with the age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) significantly increased from 39.2/100,000 to 45.9/100,000. A total of 166 countries experienced a significant increase in FBC-ASR. The most pronounced increase was mainly found in developing countries. The decrease was mostly detected in several developed countries, such as the USA and the UK. Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare carcinoma and has no evident cluster across the world. Worldwide, the number of newly diagnosed MBC cases increased from 8.5 thousand in 1990 to 23.1 thousand in 2017, with the ASR significantly increased from 0.46/100,000 to 0.61/100,000. A total of 123 countries showed a significant increasing trend in MBC-ASR. Conclusions: Breast cancer incidence rates are increasing in most countries in both sexes, although the epidemiological features were not completely shared between FBC and MBC. More emphases should be placed on breast cancer primary prevention and the prevention strategies might need to be tailored for both FBC and MBC. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {AbstractIt has been reported that some male breast cancer patients may refuse the recommended surgery, but the incidence rate in the United States is not clear. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence, trends, risk factors, and eventual survival outcomes associated with the rejection of such cancer-directed surgery.We collected data on 5860 patients with male breast cancer (MBC) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, including 50 patients refusing surgery as recommended. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to identify the effects of refusing surgery on cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). The association between acceptance or rejection of surgery and mortality were estimated by nested Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for age, race, clinical characteristics, and radiation.Of the 5860 patients identified, 50 (0.9%) refused surgery. Old age (≥65: hazard ratio [HR]: 3.056, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.738-5.374, P < .0001), higher AJCC stage (III: HR: 3.283, 95% CI: 2.134-5.050, P < .0001, IV: HR: 14.237, 95% CI: 8.367-24.226, P < .0001), progesterone receptor status (negative: HR: 1.633, 95% CI: 1.007-2.648, P = .047) were considered risk factors. Compared with the surgery group, the refusal group was associated with a poorer prognosis in both OS and CSS (χ2= 94.81, P < .001, χ2= 140.4, P < .001). Moreover, significant differences were also observed in OS and CSS among 1:3 matched groups (P = .0002, P < .001).Compared with the patients undergoing surgery, the patients who refused the cancer-directed surgery had poor prognosis in the total survival period, particularly in stage II and III. The survival benefit for undergoing surgery remained even after adjustment, which indicates the importance of surgical treatment before an advanced stage for male breast cancer patients. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) comprises <1% of all breast cancers in the United States. MBC is typically treated with total mastectomy while the majority of female breast cancer is treated with breast conservation therapy combined with various forms of radiation. One method that has developed over the last two decades is the use of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) as a type of accelerated partial breast irradiation to direct the treatment field to the tumor bed. Since overall prognosis and systemic therapy recommendations for MBC are similar to breast cancer in women, we describe the first case of MBC treated with BCS and IORT. Our patient is a 62-year-old male who was found to have a right breast 1.6 cm palpable mass at the 10:00 position 1 cm radially from the nipple. Core biopsy demonstrated invasive ductal carcinoma, moderately differentiated, estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and Her 2 Negative. The patient had a strong desire for breast conservation, and needed to minimize daily radiation treatments due to his work schedule. After discussion among our multidisciplinary tumor board, we felt this patient to be suitable for BCS and IORT given his age, favorable tumor subtype, size, and clinically early stage breast cancer. A right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy and central lumpectomy was performed. The INTRABEAM device (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany) was utilized for radiation delivery. The patient had negative margins on his final pathology. The postoperative course was uneventful and at the 6 month follow-up visit there were no issues and he had an excellent cosmetic outcome. BCS and IORT is an option in appropriately selected male patients with favorable subtype early stage breast cancer. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease for which there is limited understanding of treatment patterns and prognostic factors. Methods: Men with TNM stage I to stage III breast cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 in the National Cancer Data Base were included. Trends in treatment modalities were described using the average annual percentage change (AAPC) and estimated using Joinpoint software for the analysis of trends. Kaplan-Meier curves and the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to compare survival between subgroups and to identify prognostic factors. Results: A total of 10,873 MBC cases were included, with a median age at diagnosis of 64 years. Breast-conserving surgery was performed in 24% of patients, and 70% of patients undergoing breast conservation received radiotherapy. Approximately 44% of patients received chemotherapy, and 62% of patients with estrogen receptor–positive disease received endocrine therapy. Oncotype DX was ordered in 35% of patients with lymph node–negative, estrogen receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative tumors. During the study period, there was a significant increase in the rates of total mastectomy, contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, radiotherapy after breast conservation, ordering of Oncotype DX, and the use of endocrine therapy (P <.05). On multivariate analysis, factors found to be associated with worse overall survival were older age, black race, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, high tumor grade and stage of disease, and undergoing total mastectomy. Residing in a higher income area; having progesterone receptor–positive tumors; and receipt of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and endocrine therapy were associated with better overall survival. Conclusions: Despite the lack of prospective randomized trials in patients with MBC, the results of the current study demonstrated that the treatment of this disease has evolved over the years. These findings further the understanding of the modern treatment and prognosis of MBC, and identify several areas for further research. © 2019 American Cancer Society},

	abstract = {Purpose: To define the mutational spectrum of several candidate gene mutations in Israeli male breast cancer cases. Methods: MBC cases counselled at the Oncogenetics unit, Sheba Medical Center from January 1998 to June 2017 were included. Relevant clinical and oncological data and cancer phenotype were retrieved. All participants were genotyped for the predominant Jewish BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations using a chip-based assay. Those who tested negative were further genotyped for three recurring mutations in CHEK2 (c.1100delC, p.S428F, p.I157T), and single mutations in the FANCM (c.5791C>T), and RAD51D (c.556C>T) genes, by direct sequencing. The ethics committee approved the study. Results: Overall, 61 MBC were identified and genotyped, 41 (67.2%) were Ashkenazim, age at diagnosis was 58.1 ± 12.6 years, and 31 (50.8%) had a family history of cancer. Of genotyped individuals, one (1.6%) harboured the 185delAG* BRCA1 mutation, 7 (11.4%) the 6174delT*BRCA2 mutation and 2 (3.2%) other recurring mutations in BRCA2 (overall 10/61–16.4% BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers). Of BRCA-negative cases, 3/51 (5.9%) carried the p.S428F *CHEK2 mutation. None was a carrier of the other genotyped mutations in CHEK2, FANCM or RAD51D. Conclusion: BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 germline mutations contribute to inherited predisposition to MBC in Israel. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare disease that is still poorly understood. It is mainly classified by immunohistochemistry as a luminal disease. In this study, we assess for the first time the correlation between molecular subtypes based on a validated six-marker immunohistochemical panel and PAM50 signature in male breast cancer, and the subsequent clinical outcome of these different subtypes. We collected 67 surgical specimens of invasive male breast cancer from four different Spanish pathology laboratories. Immunohistochemical staining for the sixmarker panel was performed on tissue microarrays. PAM50 subtypes were determined in a research-use-only nCounter Analysis System. We explored the association of immunohistochemical and PAM50 subtypes. Overall survival and disease-free survival were analyzed in the different subtypes of each classification. The distribution of tumor molecular subtypes according PAM50 was: 60% luminal B, 30% luminal A and 10% human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) enriched. Only one Her2-enriched tumor was also positive by immunohistochemistry and was treated with trastuzumab. None of the tumors were basal-like. Using immunohistochemical surrogates, 51% of the tumors were luminal B, 44% luminal A, 4% triple-negative and 1% Her2-positive. The clinicopathological characteristics did not differ significantly between immunohistochemical and PAM50 subtypes. We found a significant worse overall survival in Her2-enriched compared with luminal tumors. Male breast cancer seems to be mainly a genomic luminal disease with a predominance of the luminal B subtype. In addition, we found a proportion of patients with Her2-negative by immunohistochemistry but Her2-enriched profile by PAM50 tumors with a worse outcome compared with luminal subtypes that may benefit from anti-Her2 therapies. © 2018 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The aims of this study were to analyze the metastasis pattern and prognosis of male breast cancer (MBC) and compare it with female breast cancer (FBC), and to determine the independent factors affecting the prognosis of MBC patients. Methods: Metastatic MBC diagnosed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2015 were selected. Chi-squared test was used to compare clinicopathological characteristics. Survival differences were compared by Kaplan–Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the prognostic factors affecting overall survival. Results: A total of 2754 MBC patients were identified, of which 196 had distant metastasis. Compared with nonmetastatic MBC, metastatic MBC patients had a higher proportion of <60 years old and grade III–IV, and were more likely to receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, while the proportion of surgery, central portion of the breast, and Her2–/HR+ was lower. Compared with metastatic FBC, metastatic MBC patients had a higher proportion of ⩾60 years old, central portion of the breast, surgery, simultaneous bone and lung metastasis, while the proportion of Her2+/HR–, triple negative, liver metastasis only, and simultaneous bone and liver metastasis was lower. MBC patients with lung alone, bone alone, and simultaneous lung and bone metastasis had a higher hazard ratio (2.41; 3.06; 2.52; p < 0.0001) compared with nonmetastatic patients. Conclusions: Compared with nonmetastatic MBC patients, metastatic MBC patients had unique clinicopathological features, and were also different from metastatic FBC patients. However, there was no difference in prognosis between metastatic MBC and FBC patients. Distant metastasis was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of MBC patients. © The Author(s), 2019.},

	abstract = {Whether the survival prognosis of male breast cancer differs from that of female breast cancer remains unclear. The present study used the recently updated Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data to compare the breast cancer survival outcomes between the sexes at a population level and found a significant disadvantage for the male patients. This finding suggests a need to develop male-specific treatment strategies in breast cancer. Background: Male breast cancer is rare and understudied compared with female breast cancer. A current comparison with female breast cancer could assist in bridging this gap. Although conflicting data have been reported on male and female survival outcomes, data from 1973 through 2005 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program have demonstrated that the improvement in breast cancer survival in men has fallen behind that of women. As treatment for breast cancer has improved significantly, an updated analysis using a contemporary population is necessary. Materials and Methods: An analysis of SEER data from patients with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer from 2005 to 2010 were included. A Cox regression model was used to examine the association between sex and breast cancer mortality after controlling for prognostic factors, including age, race, marital status, disease stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, lymph node involvement, tumor grade, surgery, and geography. Subgroup analyses were performed by race and stage. Results: We included a total of 289,673 breast cancer cases (2054 men) with a diagnosis from 2005 to 2010. The 5-year survival rate for male patients was lower than that for female patients (82.8% vs. 88.5%). After controlling for other factors, the risk of death in men was 43% greater than that in women during the follow-up period (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.61). Similar results were noted in the race and stage subgroup analyses. Conclusion: In recent years, male breast cancer patients have had worse survival outcomes compared with those of female patients. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

Objective: This study aimed to describe trends in the prevalence of patients hospitalised for male BC in France from 2009 to 2013, using the national administrative database (PMSI). Methods: We included all men aged ≥18 admitted to hospital for BC during this period and estimated the prevalence of male breast cancer hospitalised in France over 5 years. We also describe clinical characteristics and treatments in men with surgery for BC over the 5-year period of the study. Results: The prevalence of patients hospitalised for BC significantly decreased from 7.5 per 100,000 adult male inhabitants in 2009 to 6.3 per 100,000 in 2013. Considering the entire period, 2009–2013, we found a prevalence of 25.5 per 100,000 adult male inhabitants over 5 years. At 1 year of follow-up, we found a significant trend for at least one comorbidity (from 44.6% in 2009 to 51.2% in 2013, p = 0.04) but not for malignant nodes and metastasis. Conclusions: Ours is the first study to analyse the prevalence of patients hospitalised for male breast cancer and its changes over time in the whole population of a country.

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Due to the rarity of male breast cancer (male BC), no consensus has been reached regarding the most appropriate curative treatment strategy. The objective of the present observational study was to identify patient and tumor characteristics and assess the role of radiotherapy (RT) in clinical practice. Methods: Between 1998 and 2014, data of male BC patients treated at two breast centers were consecutively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Patients were stratified based on the addition of adjuvant RT. Data on overall survival (OS) and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Results: A consecutive cohort of 58 male BC patients was evaluated. Median follow-up was 56 months. Twenty-one patients (36.2%) received adjuvant RT. Overall, patients undergoing postoperative RT were characterized by more high-risk features. Patients receiving postoperative RT had significantly more frequently a high UICC stage (50 vs. 9.7% UICC III, p = 0.018) and positive lymph nodes as compared to patients undergoing surgery alone (65 vs. 34.4% pN+, p = 0.046). Accordingly, there was a higher proportion of patients receiving axillary lymph node dissection in the RT group (71.4 vs. 35.6%). Mastectomy was performed in 31/37 (86.1%) in the surgery group as compared to 14/21 (66.7%) in patients receiving postoperative RT. In addition, RT patients were more likely to receive endocrine therapy (78.9 vs. 39.3%, p = 0.016). Outcome was not significantly different between the groups (5-year LRFS: 89.8 vs. 80.0%, p = 0.471 and 5‑year OS 88.4 vs. 88.9%, p = 0.819). Conclusion: The present observational study evaluated the pattern of care in male BC patients treated in clinical practice. Due to its rarity, randomized clinical trials are unlikely and male BC remains an entity with a poor evidence base. Nevertheless, RT remains a crucial component of the multidisciplinary treatment strategy in male BC. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Aims: Male breast cancer is a rare disease with limited evidence-based guidelines for treatment. This study aimed to identify demographic, pathological and clinical factors associated with its prognosis. Materials and methods: A retrospective review of 161 male breast cancer patients diagnosed at a single institution from 1987 to June 2017 was conducted. Patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment and outcome were extracted and included in competing-risk analysis and the univariate Cox proportional hazard model for univariate analysis. Factors with P < 0.10 were included in multivariable analysis. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 67 years (standard deviation = 11.2) and the median follow-up duration was 5.3 years (range 0–25 years). There were 48 deaths, including 23 cancer-specific deaths. The actuarial median survival was 19.9 years. In multivariable analysis, factors associated with overall survival were size of tumours (hazard ratio 2.0; 95% confidence interval 1.4–2.7, P < 0.0001) and diagnosis of metastatic disease (hazard ratio 8.7; 95% confidence interval 1.9–40.6; P = 0.006). Of 138 patients without metastases at diagnoses, 11 had local-regional recurrence and 26 had distant metastases. In the multivariable model for local-regional recurrence, a more recent year of diagnosis was associated with reduced risk (hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.8–1.0, P = 0.008), whereas more positive lymph nodes was associated with higher risk (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2–4.0, P = 0.01). A higher risk of metastases was associated with more positive lymph nodes (hazard ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.1–3.3; P = 0.03) and tumour size (hazard ratio 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.1–2.9; P = 0.01). A higher risk of any recurrence or metastases was associated with the number of positive nodes (hazard ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2–3.0; P = 0.005) and tumour size (hazard ratio 1.6; 95% confidence interval 1.1–2.2; P = 0.01). Conclusion: In general, tumour size and more positive lymph nodes were associated with worse prognosis.

	abstract = {Management guidelines for male breast cancer have long been extrapolated from those for female breast cancer, which are based on large, randomised-controlled trials. While there are no randomised-controlled trials for male breast cancer management mainly due to the rarity of the disease, the only type of evidence available comes from retrospective studies, subject to selection biases and small sample sizes. Male breast cancer, while similar to female breast cancer in many respects, has some important differences that can affect management choices. Most cancers are oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and usually more advanced at presentation than female breast cancer. This is likely due to less breast parenchyma in male patients and delay to diagnosis. The classical management option for male patients with breast cancer is mastectomy, due to small tumour-to-breast ratio and often central position of the tumour. Breast conserving surgery is still useful in selected cases and has similar outcomes when compared to mastectomies in these patients. For patients with clinically negative lymph nodes, sentinel lymph node biopsy offers the same prognosis as axillary lymph node dissection, but with less associated morbidity. Endocrine therapy is of particular use, due to high levels of receptor positivity. Adjuvant endocrine therapy seems to significantly improve overall survival of male patients with breast cancer and while no prospective evidence exists for neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, there is hope that this is a useful management option as well. Radiotherapy is also useful in an adjuvant setting, particularly when combined with endocrine therapy. Better identification of patients, less delay from presentation to diagnosis and more collaborative efforts are key in improving the management, prognosis and outcomes of patients with male breast cancer. © 2019 AME Publishing Company.

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare and understudied disease. There is limited evidence on association between environmental and occupational agents and MBC. Some similarities in risk factors may be shared with female breast cancer. We evaluated solvents, metals, exhaust gases and other agents in relation to MBC within the large Nordic Occupational Cancer Study (NOCCA). Methods: The study included 1469 MBC cases and 7345 controls from Finland, Iceland and Sweden, matched for the date of birth, sex and country. Cases were identified through national cancer registries. Data on occupation and other demographic indicators were collected from census records and population registries. Overall, 24 occupational exposures were assessed. Exposure estimates were assigned by linking job titles to job-exposure matrices (NOCCA-JEM). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated by using conditional logistic regression models. Results: Significantly decreased overall OR was observed for physical workload (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.67–0.91). Protective effect of physical workload was stronger by increasing exposure level with significant dose-response relationship (p-trend<0.01). Non-significantly increased ORs were observed for trichloroethylene, iron, lead, chromium, welding fumes and wood dust, and decreased ORs for asbestos, silica dust and perchloroethylene. However, these results were not consistent across all analyses.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease but, as a result of epidemiological collaborations, there is now greater clarity concerning endocrine risk factors. The significant rise in global age-standardised mean BMI in men is likely to lead to increases in incidence of maturity-onset diabetes and MBC. The metabolic changes accompanying obesity decrease androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby increasing available oestrogens. The higher rates of MBC in North and Equatorial Africa are largely due to liver damage from endemic bilharziasis and hepatitis B causing elevated oestradiol (E2) levels from hepatic conversion of androgen. Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) is associated with a 50-fold increase in incidence of MBC compared with XY males, and this is the most pronounced evidence for testicular malfunction amplifying risk. Delay in presentation means that up to 40% of cases have stage III or stage IV disease at diagnosis. No randomised controlled trials have been reported on endocrine treatment of advanced disease or adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy following or preceding surgery. Tamoxifen is the most effective endocrine therapy, but side effects can lead to non-compliance in a substantial number of men. Aromatase inhibitors are less effective because they do not inhibit testicular oestrogen production. There is an urgent need for collaborative trials to provide an evidence base for the most effective endocrine and least toxic therapies for men with breast cancer. © 2018 Society for Endocrinology.},

	abstract = {Ghrelin and obestatin are two gastrointestinal peptides, derived from a common precursor. Expression of both peptides have been found in breast cancer tissue and ghrelin has been associated with breast cancer development. Ghrelin expression is associated with longer survival in women diagnosed with invasive and node negative breast cancer. The clinical implications of the peptide expression in male breast cancer are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role and potential clinical value of ghrelin and obestatin in male breast cancer. A tissue microarray of invasive male breast cancer specimens from 197 patients was immunostained with antibodies versus the two peptides. The expression of the peptides was correlated to previously known prognostic factors in breast cancer and to the outcome. No strong correlations were found between ghrelin or obestatin expression and other known prognostic factors. Only ghrelin expression was statistically significantly correlated to breast cancer-specific survival (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18–0.83) in univariate analyses and in multivariate models, adjusted for tumor size and node status (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17–0.87). HR for obestatin was 0.38 (95% CI 0.11–1.24). Ghrelin is a potential prognostic factor for breast cancer death in male breast cancer. Patients with tumors expressing ghrelin have a 2.5-fold lower risk for breast cancer death than those lacking ghrelin expression. Drugs targeting ghrelin are currently being investigated in clinical studies treating metabolic or nutritional disorders. Ghrelin should be further evaluated in forthcoming studies as a prognostic marker with the aim to be included in decision algorithms. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The development of the treatment and prognostication of male patients with breast cancer requires more attention, especially because of its reported recent increase in incidence. In the present study, we investigated the predictive survival value of the examined lymph node (LN), negative LN (NLN), and positive LN counts and the LN ratio (LNR). A strong association was found between survival and the NLN count and LNR. Considering these variables could improve prognostication further. Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is usually diagnosed at late stages and therefore has a worse prognosis than female breast cancer (FBC). MBC is also more likely to have lymph node (LN) involvement than FBC. Materials and Methods: We sought to determine the prognostic role of the examined lymph node (LN), negative LN (NLN), and positive LN counts and the LN ratio (LNR), defined as (positive LNs/ENLs), on the survival rate among MBC patients. We performed a large population-based study using the data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Results: Older age, black race, stage IV disease, ≤ 1 NLN, and a > 31.3% LNR were significantly associated with worse survival across all prediction models. Moreover, we demonstrated a decreased risk of mortality in MBC patients across the MBC-specific survival model (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-0.998; P =.03) and 10-year MBC-specific survival model (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-0.999; P =.04). Conclusion: MBC has had an augmented incidence over the years. We found several independent predictors of MBC survival, including age, race, stage, NLNs, and the LNR. We strongly suggest adding the NLN count and/or LNR into the current staging system. Further studies are needed to provide information on the mechanisms underlying the association between the NLN count and MBC survival and the LNR and MBC survival. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer is a rare and less known disease. Therapeutic modalities affect survival. In Burkina Faso, male breast cancers are diagnosed in everyday practice, but the prognosis at short-, middle-, and long-term remains unknown. The objective of this study is to study the diagnosis stages, therapeutic modalities, and 5-year survival in male breast cancer at the General Surgery Unit of Yalgado Ouedraogo University Hospital from 1990 to 2009. Methods: A cohort longitudinal study concerning cases of breast cancer diagnosed in man. Survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and survival curves were compared through the LogRank test. Results: Fifty-one cases of male breast cancer were followed-up, i.e., 2.6% of all breast cancers. Stages III and IV represented 88% of cases. Eleven patients (21.6%) were at metastatic stage. Patients were operated in 60.8% of cases. The surgery included axillary dissection in 25 (80.6%) out of 31 cases. Lumpectomy was performed on 6.5% of patients (2 cases). Fifteen (29.4%) and 11 (21.6%) patients underwent chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, respectively. The FAC protocol was mostly used. Radiation therapy was possible in two cases. The median deadline for follow-up was 14.8 months. A local recurrence was noticed in 3.2% of cases. The overall 5-year survival rate was 49.9%. The median survival was over 5 years for stages I and II. It was 54 down to 36 months for stages III and IV. Conclusion: Diagnosis is late. The lack of immunohistochemistry makes it difficult to define the proportion of their hormonal dependence. Surgery is the basic treatment. Five-year survival is slow and the median survival depends on the diagnosis stage. It can be improved through awareness-raising campaigns and the conduct of individual screening. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Given the limited data, systemic treatment of male breast cancer has been extrapolated from female patients. The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay estimates the risk of distant recurrence and chemotherapy benefit in early-stage, ER+/HER2− female breast cancer. We assessed the association between RS and type of treatment in male breast cancer. Methods: We identified male patients with ER+/HER2− breast cancer and available RS results treated at our institution in 2006–2016. We collected data on clinicopathologic features, treatment, and outcome. The Institutional Review Board approved the study. Results: The study cohort consists of 38 male breast cancer patients with a median age of 70 years. Median tumor size was 1.6 cm, and 81.6% (31) were node-negative. RS was low (≤ 17) in 26 (68.4%) cases, intermediate (18–30) in 9 (23.7%) cases, and high (≥ 31) in 3 (7.9%) cases, comparable to that in female patients at our institution. All patients underwent total mastectomy, and one received radiotherapy. Thirty-four (89.5%) patients received adjuvant endocrine therapy, mostly tamoxifen (81.6%; 31). Five (13.2%) patients with intermediate or high RS were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. No locoregional recurrence was observed, and one patient developed distant recurrence (median follow-up 34 months). Conclusions: The RS distribution in male breast cancers was similar to that in females treated at our institution. With limited follow-up, patients with low RS were spared chemotherapy and did not develop recurrence. Our results suggest that the RS may have a clinical utility in male breast cancer patients. © 2018, Society of Surgical Oncology.},

	abstract = {A potential link has been suggested between dispensed finasteride and increased risk of male breast cancer (MBC). Due to the rare occurrence of MBC, it remains to be established if such a relationship exists. The purpose of this study was to combine nationwide registers in four countries to assess the potential association between dispensed finasteride and MBC. A cohort of all males with dispensed finasteride in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden (1,365,088 person years) was followed up for up to 15 years for breast cancer, and compared to a cohort of males unexposed to finasteride. Individual-level register data included country, dates of dispensed finasteride, MBC diagnosis, and death. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using a generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution. An increased risk of MBC was found among finasteride users (IRR = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.11–1.88) compared to nonusers. The IRR increased to 1.60 (95% CI = 1.20–2.13) when users in Norway and Sweden with short follow-up time were excluded. The highest IRR was seen among men with medium duration of dispensed finasteride, medium accumulated consumption of finasteride, and among men with first dispensed finasteride prescription 1–3 years prior to diagnosis. The analyses suggested possible ascertainment bias and did not support a clear relationship between dispensed finasteride and MBC. In conclusion, a significant association between dispensed finasteride and MBC was identified. However, due to limited data for adjustment of potential confounding and surveillance bias in the present study, further research is needed to confirm these results. © 2017 The Authors.

This has resulted in limited prospective data to guide the clinical management of men with breast cancer. As a result, treatment decisions are typically extrapolated from data generated in female patients. This approach may be suboptimal, particularly considering the differing hormonal milieus between men and women with respect to both breast cancer development and treatment.

	abstract = {Background: To date, the elucidation of serum protein alterations in male breast cancer (MBC) has not been extensively studied, due to the rarity of the disease. Materials and Methods: In the present work, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) were employed to detect differences in serum protein expression between patients with MBC and healthy controls. Results: A panel of differentially expressed serum proteins was identified, including proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle [e.g. cell division cycle 7-related protein kinase (CDC7)], in mitochondrial function [e.g. mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) and dimethyladenosine transferase 1 (TFB1M)], in lipid metabolism and transport [e.g. apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) and E (APOE)], in apoptosis and immune response [e.g. CD5 antigen-like (CD5L), clusterin (CLUS) and C-C motif chemokine 14 (CCL14)], in transcription (e.g. protein SSX3 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)], in invasion and metastasis (e.g. alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (FETUA)], in estrogen synthesis [aromatase (CYP19A1)] and other diverse biological roles [e.g. actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4 (ARPC4), dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MP2K4), ectoderm-neural cortex protein 1 (ENC1), and matrix metalloproteinase-27 (MMP27)]. Conclusion: These findings provide valuable insight into the distinct clinicopathological features of MBC and indicate that select serum proteomic markers may help improve MBC management. © 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

	abstract = {Men with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations are at increased risk of developing breast cancer and may have an indication for breast cancer screening using mammography. Since breast cancer is often viewed as a woman’s disease, visibilizing and understanding men’s experience of having a BRCA mutation and specifically, of screening for breast cancer through mammography, were the objectives of this research study. The theoretical framework of interpretive phenomenology guided the process of data collection, coding, and analysis. Phenomenology is both a philosophy and research method which focuses on understanding the nature of experience from the perspectives of people experiencing a phenomenon, the essence of and commonalities among people’s experiences, and the ways in which people experience the world through their bodies. Data were collected via in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 15 male participants recruited from the Male Oncology Research and Education (MORE) Program. This article reports findings about participants’ use of gender-specific language to describe their breasts, awareness of the ways in which their bodies changed overtime, and experiences of undergoing mammograms. This study is the first to describe men with BRCA’s perceptions of their breasts and experiences of mammography in a high-risk cancer screening clinic. This study sheds light on an under-researched area—breasts and masculinities—and could potentially lead to improved clinical understanding of men’s embodied experiences of BRCA, as well as suggestions for improving the delivery of male breast cancer screening services. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the reproducibility of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique in male breast cancer. Material and methods: We retrospectively analysed 21 male patients diagnosed with breast cancer in our hospital from 2008 to 2016 with, at least, 18 months follow-up. Fifteen patients underwent selective sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) following the usual protocols with peritumoral injection of 18.5-111 MBq of 99mTc-nanocoloides and acquisition of planar images 2 hours after the injection. In 2 cases it was necessary to perform a SPECT/CT to locate the SLN. Immunohistochemistry and molecular techniques (OSNA) were used for their analysis. Six patients did not undergo SLNB because they had pathological nodes or distant disease at the time of diagnosis. Results: SLNB was performed in 15 patients. The SLN was negative in 6 patients and positive in the remaining 9. Three patients with positive SLNB did not need axillary lymphadenectomy because of the low number of copies by molecular analysis OSNA. Axillary lymphadenectomy was performed in the remaining 6 patients with the result of 4 positive axillary lymphadenectomies and 2 that did not show further extension of the disease. Conclusions: According to our experience, SLNB in males is a reproducible, useful, safe and reliable technique which avoids unnecessary axillary lymphadenectomy and prevents the appearance of undesirable effects. © 2017},

Less than 1% of all breast cancers occur in male patients, and to date, only 8 cases of metastatic breast adenocarcinoma to the oral and maxillofacial region in a male patient have been reported in the literature. An 88-year-old male with previous history of a successfully treated primary breast adenocarcinoma 12 years earlier was referred for evaluation of an oral swelling lasting 6 months. Intraoral examination revealed a 2-cm reddish, pedunculated nodule with a smooth surface located in the left retromolar region. Imaging revealed maxillary sinus involvement. The patient underwent incisional biopsy, and microscopic evaluation revealed invasive tumor islands compounded by malignant epithelial cells, sometimes exhibiting ductal arrangement, which were positive for the estrogen receptor and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15. The final diagnosis was metastatic breast adenocarcinoma. Breast metastases are exceedingly rare in the oral and maxillofacial region of male patients; however, clinicians should consider breast metastasis when evaluating reddish oral nodules in older patients, including men, especially those with a history of malignancy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Objectives The etiology of male breast cancer (MBC) is largely unknown but a causal role of exposure to organic solvents has been suggested. Previous studies on occupational risk factors of breast cancer were often restricted to women who are frequently exposed to lower levels and at a lower frequency than men. We investigated the association between MBC and occupational exposure to petroleum and oxygenated and chlorinated solvents in a multicenter case-control study of rare cancers in Europe. Methods The study included 104 MBC cases and 1901 controls. Detailed lifetime work history was obtained during interviews, together with sociodemographic characteristics, medical history and lifestyle factors. Occupational exposures to solvents were estimated from a job-exposure matrix. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression models. Results Lifetime cumulative exposure to trichloroethylene >23.9 ppm years was associated with an increased MBC risk, compared to non-exposure [OR (95% CI): 2.1 (1.2-4.0); P trend <0.01). This increase in risk persisted when only exposures that occurred ≥10 years before diagnosis were considered. In addition, a possible role for benzene and ethylene glycol in MBC risk was suggested, but no exposure-response trend was observed. Conclusions These findings add to the evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer among men professionally exposed to trichloroethylene and possibly to benzene or ethylene glycol. Further studies should be conducted in populations with high level of exposure to confirm our results. © Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health.},

	abstract = {Objective. The study was designed to construct and validate a nomogram for predicting overall survival (OS) of male breast cancer (MBC) patients with infiltrating duct carcinoma (IDC). Methods. The cohort was selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2013. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard (PH) regression models were performed. A nomogram was developed based on the significant prognostic indicators of OS. The discriminatory and predictive capacities of nomogram were assessed by Harrell’s concordance index (C-index), calibration plots, area under the curve (AUC) and the decision curve analysis (DCA). Results. The median and maximal survival time of 1862 eligible patients were 49 and 131 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P < 0.0001), marital status (P = 0.002), T stage (P < 0.0001), N stage (P = 0.021), M stage (P < 0.0001), progesterone receptor (PR) (P = 0.046), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) (P = 0.009), and chemotherapy (P = 0.003) were independent prognostic indicators of IDC of MBC. The eight variables were then combined to construct a 3-and 5-year nomogram. The C-indexes of the nomogram were0.740 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.709–0.771]) and 0.718 (95% CI [0.672–0.764]) for the internal validation and external validation, respectively. A better discriminatory capacity was observed in the nomogram compared with the SEER summary stage (P < 0.001) and AJCC TNM staging systems (6th edition; P < 0.001) with respect to OS prediction. Good consistency was detected between the nomogram prediction and actual findings, as indicated by calibration curves. The AUC for 3-and 5-year OS was 0.739 (95% CI [0.693–0.786]) and 0.764 (95% CI [0.725–0.803]) in the training cohort and 0.737 (95% CI [0.671–0.803]) and 0.735 (95% CI [0.678–0.793]) in the validation cohort, respectively. The DCA demonstrated that the survival nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusions. The nomogram was able to more accurately predict 3-and 5-year OS of MBC patients with IDC histology than were existing models. Copyright 2019 Chai et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Current treatment guidelines for male breast cancer are predominantly guided by female-only clinical trials. With scarce research, it is unclear whether breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is equivalent to mastectomy in men. We sought to compare overall survival (OS) among male breast cancer patients who underwent BCT versus mastectomy. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 8445 stage I–II (T1–2 N0–1 M0) male breast cancer patients from the National Cancer Database (2004–2014). Patients were grouped according to surgical and radiation therapy (RT). BCT was defined as partial mastectomy followed by RT. Multivariable and inverse probability of treatment-weighted (IPTW) Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare OS between treatment groups, controlling for demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics. Results: Most patients underwent total mastectomy (61.2%), whereas 18.2% underwent BCT, 12.4% underwent total mastectomy with RT, and 8.2% underwent partial mastectomy alone. In multivariable and IPTW models, partial mastectomy alone, total mastectomy alone, and total mastectomy with RT were associated with worse OS compared with BCT (p < 0.001 all). Ten-year OS was 73.8% for BCT and 56.3, 58.0 and 56.3% for other treatment approaches. Older age, higher T/N stage, histological grade, and triple-negative receptor status were associated with poorer OS (p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis by stage demonstrated similar results. Conclusions: In this national sample of male breast cancer patients, BCT was associated with greater survival. The underlying mechanisms of this association warrant further study, because more routine adoption of BCT in male breast cancer appears to translate into clinically meaningful improvements in survival. © 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Background: Doctors’ empathy is closely related to patients’ health. This study aimed to examine whether patients’ stigma and self-efficacy play a mediating role in the relationship between doctors’ empathy abilities and patients’ cellular immunity in male patients with breast cancer. Material/Methods: Doctors’ empathy scores and patients’ demographic data, disease condition, stigma, and self-efficacy were measured. Patient T cell subset was tested at admission and 3 months after the operation and was compared by paired t test. The multivariate linear regression model was applied to analyze the factors influencing the immune index. Pearson correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were applied to explore the relationships among patients’ stigma, self-efficacy, and cellular immunity and doctors’ empathy abilities. Results: At the 2 time points, only the change in NK subset was statistically significant, while the changes in percentage of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and B cells were not statistically significant. The doctors’ empathy abilities were negatively correlated with patients’ stigma and were positively related to patients’ self-efficacy. Patients’ stigma was negatively related to NK subset, while self-efficacy was positively associated with NK subset. Patients’ stigma and self-efficacy played a mediating role in the relationship between doctors’ empathy abilities and patients’ NK subset, and stigma had a stronger effect than self-efficacy. Conclusions: Doctors’ empathy abilities affected breast cancer patients’ NK subset through their stigma and self-efficacy. The mental health of male breast cancer patients need more attention and empathy education needs to be improved. © Med Sci Monit, 2018.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Thromboembolism is a common adverse event in women treated with tamoxifen (TAM) for breast cancer. The risk in male breast cancer patients is poorly investigated. We aimed to examine the risk of thrombotic events after TAM in male breast cancer patients. Patients and methods: In this prospective cohort study, 448 patients treated between May 2009 and July 2017 for male breast cancer (BC) were assessed for eligibility. Patients with follow-up shorter than 6 months were excluded. The cumulative risk of thromboembolism was evaluated. Results: The median follow-up was 47 months (range 6–101 months) with a median age of 69.4 years (range 27–89 years). Oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression levels were observed in 98.3 and 94.9% of cases, respectively. During the follow-up period, thrombotic events were documented in 21 (11.9%) of 177 patients receiving TAM and in 1 (2.5%) of 41 patients who did not receive tamoxifen. The estimated incidence was 51.9 per 1000 person-years and 21.5 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Notably, the highest risk was identified in the first 18 months, where 81% of the observed thrombotic events occurred. Patients aged older than 71 years had a significantly increased risk of thrombotic event under TAM treatment than their younger counterparts (p = 0.033). History of thrombotic event, cardiovascular and liver disease, as well as additional adjuvant treatment were not associated with increased thrombotic risk. Conclusion: The risk of thrombotic event in men treated with TAM for breast cancer is markedly increased in the first 18 months of treatment, and should be considered during treatment decisions. © 2019, Cancer Research UK.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Male breast cancer (BC) represents <1% of all BC cases. Our study aimed to define immunohistochemistry (IHC) based surrogate subtype distribution of male BCs, and to define the recurrence pattern and survival among subgroups. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with male BC admitted to Ege University School of Medicine, Medical Oncology and Radiation Oncology Clinics between 1998 and 2017. Patient demographics, pathological feature of the primary tumor, adjuvant treatment options, and survival data were analyzed. We defined intrinsic BC subtypes according to estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER-2, and ki-67 status. RESULTS We identified 58 patients with male BC. The median age at diagnosis was 59 years (IQR: 30–78), and median follow-up was 83.7 months. Invasive ductal carcinoma was the most common histology (79.3%). Of the patients, 8.6% presented with stage-4 disease. A total of 24 (41.4%) patients had luminal A-like, 28 (48.3%) had luminal B-like, 2 (3.4%) had HER-2 positive, and 4 (6.9%) had triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Eighteen deaths were observed during follow-up. The overall survival (OS) and disease- free survival (DFS) rates among BC subgroups were not statistically significant. Median OS was 161 months (95% CI 94.7–228.4) in the patient group. DFS was statistically related to initial tumor stage. CONCLUSION The disease onset was found at younger age with more locally advanced setting compared to literature. Luminal predominance was demonstrated. Initial stage but not BC subtypes predict the risk of relapse in patients with male BC. © 2019, Istanbul Tip Fakultesi. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer is rare, as it represents less than 1% of all breast cancer cases. In addition, male breast cancer appears to have a different biology than female breast cancer. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), seem to have prognostic and predictive values in a variety of cancers, including female breast cancer. However, the role of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in male breast cancer has not yet been studied. Objectives: To compare PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in male breast cancer to female breast cancer and to evaluate prognostic values in both groups. Patients and Methods: Tissue microarrays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded resection material of 247 female and 164 male breast cancer patients were stained for PD-1 and PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry. Results: PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was significantly less frequent in male than in female cancers (48.9 vs. 65.3%, p = 0.002). In contrast, PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells did not differ between the two groups. In male breast cancer, PD-1 and tumor PD-L1 were associated with grade 3 tumors. In female breast cancer, PD-1 and PD-L1 were associated with comparably worse clinicopathological variables. In a survival analysis, no prognostic value was observed for PD-1 and PD-L1 in either male and female breast cancer. In a subgroup analysis, female patients with grade 3/tumor PD-L1-negative or ER-negative/immune PD-L1-negative tumors had worse overall survival. Conclusions: PD-1 seems to be less often expressed in male breast cancer compared to female breast cancer. Although PD-1 and PD-L1 are not definite indicators for good or bad responses, male breast cancer patients may therefore respond differently to checkpoint immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors than female patients. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease. Due to its rarity, MBC research and clinical approach are mostly based upon data derived from female breast cancer (FBC). Increasing evidence indicate that on molecular level MBC may be an heterogeneous disease different from FBC. In order to investigate whether epigenetic signatures could define molecular subgroups of MBCs, we performed promoter methylation analysis of genes involved in signal transduction and hormone signalling in BRCA1/2 mutation-positive and -negative MBCs. We examined 69 MBCs, paired blood samples, and 15 normal tissues for promoter methylation of hTERT, ESR1, RASSF1, AR, MYC and WNT1 genes. MBCs showed higher gene promoter methylation levels compared to paired blood and normal breast samples. Significantly higher RASSF1 methylation levels were observed in association with BRCA1/2 mutations, HER2 expression and high tumor grade. Significantly higher AR methylation levels were observed in BRCA1/2 wild-type cases and higher WNT1 methylation levels in PR negative cases. Overall, our results indicate that alterations in gene methylation profiles are common in MBC and that methylation pattern of tumor-associated genes may allow for the identification of MBC molecular subgroups, that could have implications in clinical management of MBC patients. © Rizzolo et al.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancers (MBC) account for 1% of all breast cancers. Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation (CTRT) is not the standard of care for treating breast cancer. However, in our center, it has been routinely used in patients with locally advanced breast cancer to downsize the tumor and make it amenable to surgery. AIM: This study was conducted to examine the clinical and pathological profile and outcomes of patients with MBC treated at our institute with neoadjuvant CTRT. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was conducted at a tertiary cancer center and was retrospective in nature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All MBC patients treated with neoadjuvant CTRT at our center between 2001 and 2016 were enrolled in the study. Data were retrospectively extracted from the patients' case records. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis and the outcome variables were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Thirty-one MBC patients who received neoadjuvant CTRT were analyzed in this study. The median age of the patients was 53 years. Stage IIB disease was observed in 8/31 (26%) patients, stage III in 20/31 (64%), and stage IV in 3/31 (10%) patients. There was no grade 3 or 4 toxicity due to CTRT. Surgery was performed in 29/31 (94%) patients and none of the patients had a pathological complete response. The median duration of follow-up was 95.3 months. The 8-year event-free survival and overall survival for stage IIB, III, and IV were 75%, 50%, and 0% and 87.5%, 69%, and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report on the use of neoadjuvant CTRT in MBC. Prospective evidence from phase-3 randomized controlled trials on the safety and efficacy of CTRT in breast cancer is required before its routine use can be recommended. © 2019 Indian Journal of Cancer | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

	abstract = {Aim: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and recommendations for its clinical management are often extrapolated from those for female breast cancer, even if breast cancer (BC) has different characteristics in the two sexes. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of several individual characteristics including clinico-pathological, lifestyle and genetic factors on overall survival (OS) of a relatively large and well characterized population-based series of 166 MBCs enrolled in Tuscany. Methods: We genotyped MBC cases at BRCA1/2 genes and at 9 candidate BC susceptibility SNPs. Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression, adjusted for several individual characteristics were used. To reduce a possible selection bias related to the interval between diagnosis and enrolment of MBC cases into the study, we used the date of blood donation as the date of the start of observation for survival analysis. Results: Only smoking habits had a significant effect on OS at 10 years (for current smokers, HR: 3.34; 95% CI 1.45–7.68; p = 0.004), while lymph node status fell short of reaching statistical significance (for pN positive, HR: 2.07; 95% CI 0.93–4.55; p = 0.07). In the same multivariate analysis we found a significantly higher OS in cases with FGFR2 rs2981582 variant in the dominant transmission model (HR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.13–0.62; p = 0.028). A sensitivity analysis with left truncation showed similar results. Conclusions: Our results may contribute to shed light on factors influencing MBC survival suggesting an important role for cigarette smoking and FGFR2 rs2981582 variant, and provide clues for better patient management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancers (MBCs) are uncommon and account for 1% of all breast cancers. Medical conditions that increase the estrogen to testosterone ratio are implicated as the risk factors. Morphologically similar, but MBCs have biological differences compared with female breast cancer (FBC). Purpose: The present study was aimed to examine the immunophenotype of MBC, subsequent molecular subtypes, their association with clinicopathological features, and prognosis. Materials and Methods: We analyzed clinicopathological features of 42 cases of MBC, and classified them according to molecular classification using immunohistochemistry (IHC). This is the second largest study from India. Results and Conclusion: Median age of patients was 61 years (age range: 41-87 years). Invasive duct carcinoma comprised 95.2% of cases. Tumor grade II and III was seen in 50% and 47.6% of cases, respectively, and advanced stage disease (III/IV) was seen in 45.2% cases (n = 39). Estrogen receptor (ER) was positive in 97.6% cases, progesterone receptor (PR) in 83.3%, androgen receptor (AR) in 76.2%, HER2 in 4.8%, Cyclin-D1 in 92.9%, Bcl2 in 66.7%, GCDFP-15 in 23.8%, p53 in 16.7%, and Ki67 index was low (<14%) in 66.7% cases. Molecular subtyping of these cases revealed 64.3% of luminal A, 35.7% of luminal B, and no HER2 rich/driven category or triple negative case. There was no statistical significance between luminal A and B category pertaining to overall stage of tumor (P = 0.905). Lymph node metastasis was more commonly associated with luminal B category (P = 0.089). p53 positivity showed significant association with luminal A cases (P = 0.002) and nodal metastasis (P = 0.042). GCDFP-15 positivity showed significant association with higher tumor grade (P = 0.042) and stage (P = 0.047). Stage was the most significant prognostic marker (P < 0.0001). On follow-up (n = 27), all the six cases that showed recurrence/persistent disease were high stage (III/IV) on presentation. © 2019 Indian Journal of Pathology and Microbiology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

Two of them had palpable regional lymph nodes. Male breast carcinoma occurs in older males as in our cases. Two cases showed infiltrating ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified on histopathological evaluation, and one showed special type with apocrine differentiation. Their two-year follow-up was uneventful after modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy. Male breast carcinoma is associated with risk factors different from and overlapping with female breast carcinoma. Male breast carcinoma differs from female breast carcinoma on clinical presentation, biological behaviour and prognosis.

	abstract = {This study aims to understand the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of patients with male breast cancer (MBC) in Shanxi province of China from 2007 to 2016. Data for 77 patients with MBC were collected for analysis. Immunohistochemistry, pathological results, and other data such as demographic characteristics (age, marital status, smoking history, drinking history, and family history of cancer) as well as clinical data were investigated by retrieving information from the patients' medical records. A total of 12,404 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2007 and 2016, and 77 were patients with MBC among them. The median diagnosis age of patients with MBC was 62 years (range, 24-84 years). The most common complaint was a painless lump in the breast, accounting for 68.8% of the patients, and the main pathological type in MBC was infiltrating ductal carcinoma (66.2%). In terms of hormone receptors, 80.5% (62/77) of patients with MBC were estrogen receptor positive, 75.3% (58/77) of patients were progesterone receptor positive, and only 6.5% (5/77) of patients were HER2 overexpressing. The multivariant Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that M stage is an independent prognostic factor (p=0.018, HR=18.791, 95% CI 1.663 to 212.6). The epidemiological and clinical features of Chinese MBC are similar to that of other countries. As the Chinese public have limited knowledge of MBC, it is necessary to increase awareness among them about it. Further research with a large sample size is required for better understanding of the risks associated with MBC. © American Federation for Medical Research 2019.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) incidence seems to parallel global increases in obesity. The stromal microenvironment contributes to carcinogenesis; yet, the role of adipocytes in this is understudied in MBC. We identified four cohorts of male breast tissues diagnosed when obesity was rare (archival cohort) and more common (contemporary cohort). We examined the microenvironment of archival and contemporary cohorts of MBC, diagnosed 1940–1970 and 1998–2006, respectively, with two cohorts of, archival and contemporary gynaecomastia, diagnosed 1940–1979 and 1996–2011, respectively, serving as controls. We quantified adipocytes, crown-like structures (CLS) and the presence of CD8, α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and CD68+ macrophages in both cohorts, and determined how these affected survival, in the contemporary MBC cohort. In both MBC cohorts, mean adipocyte diameter was larger in the distant stroma compared with stroma close to the invading tumour (92.2µm vs 66.7µm). This was not seen in gynaecomastia. CLS were more frequent in both MBC cohorts than gynaecomastia (44/55 (80%) vs 11/18 (61%), P<0.001). No relationship was found between CLS number and adipocyte size, although there were greater numbers of CLS in contemporary MBC>archival MBC>gynaecomastia. CD8 and CD68 expression in the stroma was significantly associated with reduced survival, with no effects seen with αSMA. Changes in the adipose-inflammatory microenvironment may be a contributing factor to the increase seen in MBC diagnosis. © 2018 Society for Endocrinology Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.},

METHODS ASCO convened an Expert Panel to develop recommendations based on a systematic review and a formal consensus process. RESULTS Twenty-six descriptive reports or observational studies met eligibility criteria and formed the evidentiary basis for the recommendations. RECOMMENDATIONS Many of the management approaches used for men with breast cancer are like those used for women. Men with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who are candidates for adjuvant endocrine therapy should be offered tamoxifen for an initial duration of five years; those with a contraindication to tamoxifen may be offered a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist plus aromatase inhibitor. Men who have completed five years of tamoxifen, have tolerated therapy, and still have a high risk of recurrence may be offered an additional five years of therapy. Men with early-stage disease should not be treated with bone-modifying agents to prevent recurrence, but could still receive these agents to prevent or treat osteoporosis. Men with advanced or metastatic disease should be offered endocrine therapy as first-line therapy, except in cases of visceral crisis or rapidly progressive disease. Targeted systemic therapy may be used to treat advanced or metastatic cancer using the same indications and combinations offered to women. Ipsilateral annual mammogram should be offered to men with a history of breast cancer treated with lumpectomy regardless of genetic predisposition; contralateral annual mammogram may be offered to men with a history of breast cancer and a genetic predisposing mutation. Breast magnetic resonance imaging is not recommended routinely. Genetic counseling and germline genetic testing of cancer predisposition genes should be offered to all men with breast cancer. © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

A mixed-methods design is applied including data of qualitative interviews (N = 27 MBCP) and a written questionnaire (N = 100 MBCP). MBCP use different resources of support from their social environment like partners, family, friends, colleagues, other breast cancer patients, and medical experts. Mostly, MBCP receive emotional and informational support. They often receive emotional support from their partners and informational support from medical experts. Different types of social support usage can be identified dependent on age, occupation, and severity of disease. The older the patients and the less the disease severity, the less social support MBCP use. Within cancer care, partners and the closer social environment should be included more as they are a key resource for MBCP. As health-care professions might also be an important resource of support for MBCP, further research should examine this resource. © The Author(s) 2019.},

This study is aimed to compare the accuracy of clinical measurement (CE), ultrasound (US) and mammography (MG) for preoperative estimation of tumour size. Methods: This study was conducted as a prospective, multicentre register study. One hundred and twenty-nine male patients with invasive breast cancer were included. CE, US and MG were performed in 107, 110 and 75 patients, respectively, and the estimated tumour size was compared with the histopathological (HP) tumour size. Results: All methods tended to underestimate the HP tumour size. None of the methods were significantly more accurate than the others in determining the maximal tumour diameter. The sensitivity within 5 mm tolerance for US was 65.5%, which was better than for MG (61.3%) and CE (56.6%). In the group of patients with pT2 tumours, MG showed significantly better accuracy than US. The measurements obtained with each method were significantly correlated with the HP measurements. The highest correlation coefficient was observed for MG (0.788), followed by US (0.741) and CE (0.671). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that MG and US have similar accuracy with regard to tumour size estimation. US assessment showed the highest sensitivity in determining tumour size, followed by MG and CE. However, MG demonstrated a significant advantage for estimating the real tumour size for pT2 tumours compared to US or CE. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Cases were tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess the X chromosome status and AR amplification. AR expression was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In addition, AR methylation status was assessed. X chromosome gain was observed in 74.7% of invasive duct carcinoma, in 20.6% of in situ duct carcinoma, and in 14.6% of gynecomastia when associated with cancer, while all cases of tumor-free gynecomastia showed wild X chromosome asset. AR gene copy number when increased paralleled the number of X chromosomes. AR IHC expression was observed in 100% of MBC tested. AR gene methylation status revealed low level or absence of methylation. These data suggest that X chromosome can play a role in the neoplastic transformation of male breast epithelium. X chromosome gain is paralleled by AR gene polysomy. Polysomic AR genes show low methylation levels and high AR protein expression on IHC. These data should be taken into consideration for MBC treatment planning. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer is an uncommon disease often discovered in advanced stage; thus, in the setting of metastatic adenocarcinoma, breast origin must be taken to account. Breast markers as NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and BRST-2 are established tools for labelling primary and metastatic female breast cancer; however, none of them has been sufficiently studied in male breast cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of these markers in male breast cancer. Materials and methods: Thirty consecutive cases of male breast cancer and eight loco-regional metastases were re-revaluated, assembled in tissue micro array (TMA), and stained with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and BRST-2. The IHC stains were scored either positive or negative. In addition, concordant expression patterns of primary tumors and matched metastasis were noted. Results: 30 of 30 (100%) primary tumors and 8 of 8 (100%) metastases were positive for NY-BR-1. 30 of 30 (100%) primary tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for GATA-3. 22 of 30 (73.3%) primary tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for Mammaglobin. 18 of 30 (60%) primary tumors and 5 of 8 (62.5%) metastases were positive for BRST-2. Differences in staining percentage were not significant with Fisher’s exact test. Conclusion: We found a high sensitivity for all the markers analyzed. Moreover, the expression of NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 seemed the most effective for labelling male breast cancer in primary and metastatic setting. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In detection, treatment, and follow-up, male breast cancer has historically lagged behind female breast cancer. On the whole, breast cancer is less common among men than among women, limiting utility of screening, yet the incidence of male breast cancer is rising, and there are men at high risk for breast cancer.While women at high risk for breast cancer are well characterized, with clearly established guidelines for screening, supplemental screening, risk prevention, counseling, and advocacy, men at high risk for breast cancer are poorly identified and represent a blind spot in public health. Today, more standardized genetic counseling and wider availability of genetic testing are allowing identification of high-risk male relatives of women with breast cancer, as well as men with genetic mutations predisposing to breast cancer. This could provide a new opportunity to update our approach to male breast cancer. This article reviews male breast cancer demographics, risk factors, tumor biology, and oncogenetics; recognizes how male breast cancer differs from its female counterpart; highlights its diagnostic challenges; discusses the implications of the widening clinical use of multigene panel testing; outlines current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (version 1, 2018) for high-risk men; and explores the possible utility of targeted screening and surveillance. Understanding the current state of male breast cancer management and its challenges is important to shape future considerations for care. Shifting the paradigm of male breast cancer detection toward targeted precision medicine may be the answer to improving clinical outcomes of this uncommon disease. © RSNA, 2018.},

The available data have been reviewed to identify reasonable options and reveal areas in need of investigation. Methods: All published series on the surgical management of MBC have been reviewed to determine approaches to treatment of the primary, the breast and the axilla together with the psychological sequelae of surgery. Findings: Mastectomy is still the major surgical offer but a convincing case can be made for the use of neoadjuvant endocrine treatment in order to facilitate breast conserving surgery. Sentinel node biopsy has been successfully used for staging MBC although nomograms for prediction of nodal status are inadequately calibrated. There are psychological sequelae of mastectomy in males and as yet no evidence that the needs of those with MBC are being met. Conclusions: Collaborative studies are required so that men can participate in meaningful RCTs to provide an evidence-based rational foundation for the surgery of MBC. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Inherited mutations in BRCA1, and, mainly, BRCA2 genes are associated with increased risk of male breast cancer (MBC). Mutations in PALB2 and CHEK2 genes may also increase MBC risk. Overall, these genes are functionally linked to DNA repair pathways, highlighting the central role of genome maintenance in MBC genetic predisposition. MUTYH is a DNA repair gene whose biallelic germline variants cause MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) syndrome. Monoallelic MUTYH variants have been reported in families with both colorectal and breast cancer and there is some evidence on increased breast cancer risk in women with monoallelic variants. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether MUTYH germline variants may contribute to MBC susceptibility. To this aim, we screened the entire coding region of MUTYH in 503 BRCA1/2 mutation negative MBC cases by multigene panel analysis. Moreover, we genotyped selected variants, including p.Tyr179Cys, p.Gly396Asp, p.Arg245His, p.Gly264Trpfs*7, and p.Gln338His, in a total of 560 MBC cases and 1,540 male controls. Biallelic MUTYH pathogenic variants (p.Tyr179Cys/p.Arg241Trp) were identified in one MBC patient with phenotypic manifestation of adenomatous polyposis. Monoallelic pathogenic variants were identified in 14 (2.5%) MBC patients, in particular, p.Tyr179Cys was detected in seven cases, p.Gly396Asp in five cases, p.Arg245His and p.Gly264Trpfs*7 in one case each. The majority of MBC cases with MUTYH pathogenic variants had family history of cancer including breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers. In the case-control study, an association between the variant p.Tyr179Cys and increased MBC risk emerged by multivariate analysis [odds ratio (OR) = 4.54; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-17.58; p = 0.028]. Overall, our study suggests that MUTYH pathogenic variants may have a role in MBC and, in particular, the p.Tyr179Cys variant may be a low/moderate penetrance risk allele for MBC. Moreover, our results suggest that MBC may be part of the tumor spectrum associated with MAP syndrome, with implication in the clinical management of patients and their relatives. Large-scale collaborative studies are needed to validate these findings.

	abstract = {AbsractRationale: Although still relatively rare, multiple primary malignant neoplasms (MPMNs) have been increasingly reported in recent years. Patient concerns and diagnoses: A 65-year-old man was referred to our hospital for a painless, incidental left axillary lump. Ultrasound showed enlarged left axillary lymph nodes. An excisional biopsy was conducted on 3 lymph nodes. The pathological diagnosis was determined to be metastatic adenocarcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the lymph nodes. Further physical examination of the patient yielded a 1.5-cm hard, left subareolar mass. Interventions and outcomes: The patient underwent modified radical mastectomy. The diagnosis was grade II invasive ductal carcinoma (stage IIA). The axillary lymph node showed MCL (stage I, group A), but not metastatic ductal carcinoma. The patient received chemotherapy, including 6 courses of CHOP (A chemotherapy protocol consists of cyclophosphamide 1.2 g day 1, doxorubicin 80 mg day 1, vindesine 4 mg day1, and prednisone 90 mg from day 1 to 5) for lymphoma and breast cancer. The patient was also administered endocrine therapy. After a 54-month follow-up, the patient was well with no evidence of disease. Lessons: MPMNs are easily misdiagnosed as a primary and metastatic tumor, leading to delayed or erroneous treatment. Male breast cancer in a patient with MCL is rare. Early diagnosis and proper therapy are necessary for an optimal prognosis. Further studies are required to define the mechanisms and risk factors of MPMNs. Copyright © 2017 the Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: In case reports, concerns have been raised as to whether finasteride use increases the risk of Male breast cancer. Previous epidemiologic evidence on the potential link is conflicting. This study aimed to assess whether an association between finasteride use and Male breast cancer exists after accounting for potential confounders. Methods: The source population consisted of all men (35 years) from Denmark (1995–2014), Finland (1997–2013), and Sweden (2005–2014). Cases with incident Male breast cancer were identified in the cancer registries and matched with 50 density-sampled, age, and country-matched Male population controls per case. Exposure information on finasteride use was derived from the prescription registries. Potential confounders were identified using the directed acyclic graph methodology and measured by use of information from nation-wide registries. Results: The study population comprised 1,005 Male breast cancer cases and 43,058 controls. Confounder-adjusted odds of finasteride exposure were not statistically significantly increased [OR, 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77–1.54] in breast cancer cases relative to controls. There was no evidence of a dose–response relationship, as the group with greatest exposure to finasteride was associated with lowest OR of Male breast cancer [OR, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.40–1.30)]. Sensitivity analyses did not reveal marked changes in results with different exposure definitions or for specific subgroups. Conclusions: Results from this study provided no evidence that finasteride use was associated with Male breast cancer. Impact: This large confounder-adjusted study supports the view that exposure to finasteride is not associated materially with Male breast cancer risk. © 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In order to better define the breast cancer (BC) genetic risk factors in men, a germline investigation was carried out on 81 Male BC cases by screening the 24 genes involved in BC predisposition, genome stability maintenance and DNA repair mechanisms by next-generation sequencing. Methods: Germline DNAs were tested in a custom multi-gene panel focused on all coding exons and exon–intron boundaries of 24 selected genes using two amplicon-based assays on PGM-Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher Scientific) and MiSeq (Illumina) platforms. All variants were recorded and classified by using a custom pipeline. Results: Clinical pathological data and the family history of 81 Male BC cases were gathered and analysed, revealing the average age of onset to be 61.3 years old and that in 35 cases there was a family history of BC. Our genetic screening allowed us to identify a germline mutation in 22 patients (23%) in 4 genes: BRCA2, BRIP1, MUTYH and PMS2. Moreover, 12 variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) in 9 genes (BARD1, BRCA1, BRIP1, CHEK2, ERCC1, NBN, PALB2, PMS1, RAD50) were predicted as potentially pathogenic by in silico analysis bringing the mutation detection rate up to 40%. Conclusion: As expected, a positive family history is a strong predictor of germline BRCA2 mutations in male BC. Understanding the potential pathogenicity of VUS represents an extremely urgent need for the management of BC risk in Male BC cases and their own families. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {To establish whether existing mutation prediction models can identify which male breast cancer (MBC) patients should be offered BRCA1 and BRCA2 diagnostic DNA screening, we compared the performance of BOADICEA (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm), BRCAPRO (BRCA probability) and the Myriad prevalence table (“Myriad”). These models were evaluated using the family data of 307 Dutch MBC probands tested for BRCA1/2, 58 (19%) of whom were carriers. We compared the numbers of observed vs predicted carriers and assessed the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) for each model. BOADICEA predicted the total number of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers quite accurately (observed/predicted ratio: 0.94). When a cut-off of 10% and 20% prior probability was used, BRCAPRO showed a non-significant better performance (observed/predicted ratio BOADICEA: 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.60-1.09] and 0.79, 95% CI: [0.57-1.09], vs. BRCAPRO: 1.02, 95% CI: [0.75-1.38] and 0.94, 95% CI: [0.68-1.31], respectively). Myriad underestimated the number of carriers in up to 69% of the cases. BRCAPRO showed a non-significant, higher AUC than BOADICEA (0.798 vs 0.776). Myriad showed a significantly lower AUC (0.671). BRCAPRO and BOADICEA can efficiently identify MBC patients as BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Besides their general applicability, these tools will be of particular value in countries with limited healthcare resources. © 2017 The Authors. Clinical Genetics published by John Wiley & Sons A/S.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare and neglected disease. Prognostic and predictive factors in MBC are extrapoled from trials conducted on its female counterpart. OBJECTIVE: Since the relationship between the transcription factor Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) expression and the clinical response to chemotherapy and hormonotherapy in MBC remains unknown, we sought to investigate the predictive value of FOXM1 in MBC. Methods: FOXM1 expression was assessed in 130 MBC cases. Clinical significance was analyzed by Kaplan Meier curves, log-rank test and multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Patients with high FOXM1 expression had a significantly lower response rate to chemotherapy (P = 0:045) and hormonotherapy (P = 0:029) than those with low FOXM1 expression. Multivariate analyses indicated that FOXM1 was an independent prognostic factor for disease free survival in MBC patients (P < 0:001). CONCLUSIONS: FOXM1 may have a reliable predictive significance in male breast cancer and thus may become an important target for male breast cancer therapy in the near future. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare malignancy, with recurrence being one of the main adverse predictors for prognosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic and predictive value of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT in the setting of suspected recurrence of MBC. Patients and methods Retrospective analysis of PET/CT findings was performed in 23 previously treated, histologically proven patients with MBC (mean age: 59.3±10.9 years; range: 36-79 years) with suspected recurrence. Kaplan-Meier disease-specific survival analysis was made with respect to histological, hormonal profile as well as PET/CT findings. Results Of the 23 patients, 19 (82.6%) showed recurrence. Recurrence at primary site with/without regional/distant site recurrence was seen in 12 (52.2%) patients. Only metastatic recurrence without primary site was seen in seven (30.4%) patients. Bone was the most common site of distant metastasis (14/23) followed by lungs (9/23), liver (4/23), brain (2/23), and adrenal (1/23). No recurrence (regional/distant) was noted in 4/23 (17.3%) patients; however, three of them had 18F-FDG-avid soft tissue lesions in esophagus, rectum and tongue, correspondingly, confirmed as second primaries with histopathology. Disease-specific survival analysis yielded nodal (P=0.01) as well as distant metastases (P=0.02) as the main survival predictors on PET/CT. Lung (P=0.001), followed by liver (P=0.009), and skeletal (P=0.01) metastases were the most adverse survival predictive factors. Conclusion 18F-FDG PET/CT showed good diagnostic and prognostic utility in recurrent MBC. It was better than bone scan in evaluation of skeletal metastases. Most importantly, 18F-FDG PET/CT helped in early detection of second malignancy and their clinical management in studied patients. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rate of male breast cancer occurrences has been increasing over the last years and, in the absence of proper protocols, the treatment proposed for male breast cancer follows the one established for the female breast neoplasia. The objective of the present study is to simulate the treatment of male breast cancer through the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code, using the voxelized Alderson Rando phantom, following the protocol used on female breast cancer and compare the simulated results with the experimental values obtained with thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD). A treatment configuration using the Alderson Rando phantom with placement of TLDs was performed, which had reproducibility on the simulation. The results obtained in the simulation were up to 12% greater than the doses planned, and up to 15% lesser than the measurements with TLDs. The results suggest that the treatment of male breast cancer using the treatment protocol for female breast neoplasia must be reviewed, once higher dose values are observed in comparison to those obtained by the planning system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein coding RNAs that modulate gene expression after transcription. Few studies have shown that male breast cancer (MBC) shows distinctive miRNAs pattern, suggesting its relevance in this pathology. To study this, we performed a profile of 800 miRNAs in 9 MBC samples and in normal epithelial cells of 3 MBC cases. Experimental Design: Of FFPE tissues, miRNA was extracted for profiles using the NanoString method. miRNAs were obtained by comparing tumor samples versus normal epithelium. Quantitative real-time PCR analyzes were performed by the TaqMan approach for specific miRNAs. Results: The profile of 800 miRNAs showed a different microRNA expression pattern between MBC and its normal counterpart, suggesting a specific microRNA cancer expression profile for MBC. Forty-nine miRNAs showed greater expression, while 26 were found to be down-regulated in MBC, compared to normal tissue. The lower expression of miR-125b correlated significantly with tumors > 2 cm, suggesting that its down-regulation may be implicated in mechanisms to more aggressive tumors. Conclusions: These results suggest that MBC has a unique expression profile compared to normal breast tissue and expression profile of female breast cancer. Differentially expressed miRNAs provide insights of this uncommon but highly aggressive pathology. © Ivyspring International Publisher.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is extremely rare and accounts for less than 1% of all breast malignancies. Therefore, clinical management of MBC is currently guided by research on the disease in females. In this study, DNA obtained from 45 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) MBCs with and 90 MBCs (52 FFPE and 38 fresh-frozen) without matched normal tissues was subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting all exons of 1943 cancer-related genes. The landscape of mutations and copy number alterations was compared to that of publicly available estrogen receptor (ER)-positive female breast cancers (smFBCs) and correlated to prognosis. From the 135 MBCs, 90% showed ductal histology, 96% were ER-positive, 66% were progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, and 2% HER2-positive, resulting in 50, 46 and 4% luminal A-like, luminal B-like and basal-like cases, respectively. Five patients had Klinefelter syndrome (4%) and 11% of patients harbored pathogenic BRCA2 germline mutations. The genomic landscape of MBC to some extent recapitulated that of smFBC, with recurrent PIK3CA (36%) and GATA3 (15%) somatic mutations, and with 40% of the most frequently amplified genes overlapping between both sexes. TP53 (3%) somatic mutations were significantly less frequent in MBC compared to smFBC, whereas somatic mutations in genes regulating chromatin function and homologous recombination deficiency-related signatures were more prevalent. MDM2 amplifications were frequent (13%), correlated with protein overexpression (P = 0.001) and predicted poor outcome (P = 0.007). In conclusion, despite similarities in the genomic landscape between MBC and smFBC, MBC is a molecularly unique and heterogeneous disease requiring its own clinical trials and treatment guidelines. © 2019 Society for Endocrinology Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.

	abstract = {Accessory male breast cancer (BC) is a rare entity and is associated with poor outcome. We report a 76-year-old patient who was diagnosed with concurrent accessory breast and primary lung cancer, both were positive for somatic BRCA-2 (E1593D) mutation. He received concurrent radiation and platinum-based chemotherapy for lung cancer with good response, but breast cancer progressed in about 8 months, and further progressed after single agent anastrozole in 10 months. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of breast cancer was also positive for CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and FGFR1 amplifications. Despite a poor molecular profile of breast cancer, and progression following platinum-based chemotherapy and anastrozole, he was successfully treated with the Cyclin-dependent kinase (CKD) 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, estrogen-receptor down-regulator fulvestrant and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist leuprolide with the duration of response of 21 months which has exceeded duration of response to prior treatments.

	abstract = {Background: Although marital status has been reported as a prognostic factor in different cancer types, its prognostic effect on hormone receptor (HR) positive male breast cancer (MBC) is unclear. The objective of the present analysis was to assess the effects of marital status on survival in patients with HR positive MBC. Material/Methods: Patients diagnosed with HR positive MBC from 1990 to 2014 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were included. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to identify the effects of marital status on cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 3612 cases were identified in this study. Married patients had better 5-year CSS and 5-year OS than unmarried men. In multivariate Cox regression models, unmarried patients also showed higher mortality risk for both CSS and OS, independent of age, race, grade, stage, PR status, HER2 status, and surgery. Subgroup survival analysis according to different ER/PR status showed that married patients had beneficial CSS results only in ER+/PR+ subtype, and CSS in the married and unmarried groups did not significantly differ by TNM stage. The results were further confirmed in the 1: 1 matched group. Conclusions: Marital status was an important prognostic factor for survival in patients with HR positive MBC. Unmarried patients are at greater risk of death compared with married groups. The survival benefit for married patients remained even after adjustment, which indicates the importance of spousal support in MBC. © Med Sci Monit, 2018.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare and aggressive disease. Thus, identification of new therapeutic targets is crucial. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the protein expression of MARCKS (Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C-Kinase Substrate) in MBC and to investigate its prognostic value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MARCKS protein expression in tumor and stromal cells was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a retrospective series of 96 pre-chemotherapy MBC samples and 80 normal breast samples, from Tunisian patients treated at Salah Azaiez Institute. Correlations were searched between MARCKS expression and clinicopathological features including overall survival (OS). RESULTS: MARCKS was overexpressed in epithelial tumor cells in 66% of the MBC samples versus 26% of normal samples (p= 1.40 × 10-7). Such positive MARCKS expression in epithelial tumor cells was associated with positive HER2 status (p= 4.0 × 10-3). It was associated with shorter OS in uni-and multivariate analysis. By contrast, stromal IHC MARCKS expression was correlated only with tumor grade. CONCLUSION: MARCKS tumor cell overexpression might in part explain the aggressiveness and the poor prognosis of MBC. MARCKS can represent a potential therapeutic target for MBC. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) in men is rare and genetic predisposition is likely to play a relevant role in its etiology. Inherited mutations in BRCA1/2 account for about 13% of all cases and additional genes that may contribute to the missing heritability need to be investigated. In our study, a well-characterized series of 523 male BC (MBC) patients from the Italian multicenter study on MBC, enriched for non-BRCA1/2 MBC cases, was screened by a multigene custom panel of 50 cancer-associated genes. The main clinical-pathologic characteristics of MBC in pathogenic variant carriers and non-carriers were also compared. BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants were detected in twenty patients, thus, a total of 503 non-BRCA1/2 MBC patients were examined in our study. Twenty-seven of the non-BRCA1/2 MBC patients were carriers of germline pathogenic variants in other genes, including two APC p.Ile1307Lys variant carriers and one MUTYH biallelic variant carrier. PALB2 was the most frequently altered gene (1.2%) and PALB2 pathogenic variants were significantly associated with high risk of MBC. Non-BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers were more likely to have personal (p = 0.0005) and family (p = 0.007) history of cancer. Results of our study support a central role of PALB2 in MBC susceptibility and show a low impact of CHEK2 on MBC predisposition in the Italian population. Overall, our data indicate that a multigene testing approach may benefit from appropriately selected patients with implications for clinical management and counseling of MBC patients and their family members. © 2019 UICC},

Of 1054 M0 cases, 56.2% were node-negative (N0) and 48.5% had T1 tumors; 4% had breast conserving surgery (BCS), 18% sentinel lymph-node biopsy; half received adjuvant radiotherapy; 29.8% (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and 76.8% adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), mostly tamoxifen (88.4%). Per central pathology, for M0 tumors: 84.8% ductal invasive carcinomas, 51.5% grade 2; 99.3% estrogen receptor (ER)-positive; 81.9% progesterone receptor (PR)-positive; 96.9% androgen receptor (AR)-positive [ER, PR or AR Allred score ≥ 3]; 61.1% Ki67 expression low (<14% positive cells); using immunohistochemistry (IHC) surrogates, 41.9% were Luminal-A-like, 48.6% Luminal-B-like/HER-2-negative, 8.7% HER-2-positive, 0.3% triple negative. Median follow-up: 8.2 years (0.0-23.8) for all, 7.2 years (0.0-23.2), for M0, 2.6 years (0.0-12.7) for M1 patients. A significant improvement over time was observed in age-corrected BC mortality. BC-specific-mortality was higher for men younger than 50 years. Better overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were observed for highly ER+(P=0.001), highly PR+(P=0.002), highly AR+ disease (P=0.019). There was no association between OS/RFS and HER-2 status, Ki67, IHC subtypes nor grade. Conclusions: Male BC is usually ER, PR and AR-positive, Luminal B-like/HER2-negative. Of note, 56% patients had T1 tumors but only 4% had BCS. ER was highly positive in > 90% of cases but only 77% received adjuvant ET. ER, PR and AR were associated with OS and RFS, whereas grade, Ki67 and IHC surrogates were not. Significant improvement in survival over time was observed. © The Author 2017.

	abstract = {Breast cancer in men is a rare and still poorly characterized disease. Inherited mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2 genes, as well as common polymorphisms, play a role in male breast cancer genetic predisposition. Male breast cancer is considered a hormone-dependent tumor specifically related to hyperestrogenism. Polymorphisms in genes involved in estrogen biosynthesis and metabolism pathways, such as CYP17A1 and CYP1B1, have been associated with breast cancer risk. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of CYP17A1 and CYP1B1 polymorphisms in male breast cancer risk. A series of 597 male breast cancer cases and 1022 male controls, recruited within the Italian Multicenter Study on male breast cancer, was genotyped for CYP17A1 rs743572, CYP1B1 rs1056836 and rs1800440 polymorphisms by allelic discrimination real-time PCR with TaqMan probes. Associations with male breast cancer risk were estimated using logistic regression. No statistically significant associations between male breast cancer risk and the three analyzed polymorphisms emerged. Similar results were obtained also when BRCA1/2 mutational status was considered. No significant differences in the distribution of the genotypes according to estrogen receptor status emerged. In conclusion, our study, based on a large series of male breast cancer cases, is likely to exclude a relevant role of CYP17A1 and CYP1B1 polymorphisms in male breast cancer predisposition. Overall, these results add new data to the increasing evidence that polymorphisms in these genes may not be associated with breast cancer risk. © 2019 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.},

Material and Methods: We systematically searched Medline via PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library Central Register up to May 2017 to identify published articles related to 5ARIs and the risk of MBC. Results: Summary effect estimates were calculated by a random-effect model, and tests for multivariable-unadjusted pooled risk ratios (RR) and heterogeneity, as well as the sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess publication bias. All four studies were conducted in a quality assessment according to the Newcastle Ottawa Scale system. The strength of association between 5ARIs and the prevalence of MBC was evaluated by using summarized unadjusted pooled RR with a 95% confidence interval [CI]. Four studies involving 595.776 participants, mean age range from 60 to 73.2 years old, were included in a meta-analysis, which produced a summary unadjusted RR of the risk of MBC for the treatment of 5ARIs of 1.16 (95% CI 0.85-1.58, P=0.36) and the multivariable-adjusted RR is 1.03, (95% CI 0.75-1.41, p=0.86). There was no heterogeneity among included studies (I2=0%, P=0.49). Estimates of total effects were generally consistent with the sensitivity. Conclusion: We did not observe a positive association between the use of 5ARIs and MBC. The small number of breast cancer cases exposed to 5ARIs and the lack of an association in our study suggest that the development of breast cancer should not influence the prescribing of 5ARIs therapy. © 2018 Brazilian Society of Urology.},

Therefore, a mixed methods design is applied including data of N = 27 qualitative interviews with MBCP and quantitative data of N = 100 MBCP. Findings identify a diverse picture, as stigmatization varies between contexts and patients: Most stigmatization concentrates on sexual stigmatization and ignorance of MBC and mostly occurs in cancer care systems and work-related contexts. The level of stigmatization varies with age and amount of treatment methods received, as reported within the created typology of different MBCP stigma types. To prospectively reduce stigmatization in MBCP, more publicity of MBC is needed, as well as gender-neutral communication and information material. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare tumor with few cases for research. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database, we carried out a competing risk analysis in patients with primary nonmetastatic MBC and built a predictive nomogram. Materials and Methods: We extracted primary nonmetastatic MBC patients according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Cumulative incidence function (CIF) and proportional subdistribution hazard model were adopted to explore risk factors for breast cancer-specific death (BCSD) and other cause-specific death (OCSD). Then we built a nomogram to predict the 3-year, 5-year and 8-year probabilities of BCSD and OCSD. C-indexes, Brier scores and calibration curves were chosen for validation. Results: We identified 1,978 nonmetastatic MBC patients finally. CIF analysis showed that the 3-year, 5-year and 8-year mortalities were 5.2%, 10.6% and 16.5% for BCSD, and 6.1%, 9.6% and 14.4% for OCSD. After adjustment of Fine and Gray models, black race, PR (-), advanced T/N/grade and no surgery were independently associated with BCSD. Meanwhile, elderly, unmarried status, advanced AJCC stage and no chemotherapy resulted in OCSD more possibly. A graphic nomogram was developed according to the coefficients from the Fine and Gray models. The calibration curves displayed exceptionally, with C-indexes nearly larger than 0.700 and Brier scores nearly smaller than 0.100. Conclusion: The competing risk nomogram showed good accuracy for predictive prognosis in nonmetastatic MBC patients. It was a useful implement to evaluate crude mortalities of BCSD and OCSD, and help clinicians to choose appropriate therapeutic plans. © 2018 Ivyspring International Publisher.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for 1% of all breast cancer. Adult obesity and tallness are risk factors for MBC, but the role of adolescent fatness is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the association between body mass index (BMI) in adolescence and the incidence of MBC in a large cohort of 16- to 19-year-old Israeli males. 1,382,093 Jewish Israeli males aged 16–19 who underwent anthropometric measurements, a general intelligence test (GIT) and other examinations during 1967–2011, were followed up to December 31, 2012 for MBC incidence. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the association between adolescent BMI (as WHO BMI categories and as age-specific CDC percentiles) and time to MBC diagnosis, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Of 100 MBC cases diagnosed during 29,386,233 person-years of follow-up, 97 were included in multivariable analyses. Compared to “healthy” BMI (18.5–24.9 kg/m2) and adjusted for year of birth, country of origin and GIT score, higher adolescent BMI was associated with higher MBC risk: hazard ratio (HR) = 2.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–3.55, p = 0.015) in overweight (25.0 ≤ BMI < 30.0 kg/m2) adolescents; and HR = 4.97 (95%CI 2.14–11.53, p = 0.0002) in obese (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2) adolescents. When CDC age-specific BMI percentiles were assessed results were similar and statistically significant for obesity. In addition, low (vs. high) GIT score (HR = 4.76, 95%CI 1.96–12.50, p = 0.001) and European (vs. west-Asian) origin (HR = 1.99, 95%CI 1.19–3.34, p = 0.009) were independent predictors of MBC. Measured adolescent overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of MBC, suggesting a modifiable risk factor potentially allowing for early intervention. The novel association with cognitive function should be further explored. © 2017 UICC.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study was designed to analyze the effects of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status on the prognosis of male breast cancer (MBC). Methods: The SEER database was used to identify MBC patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2015. Patients were divided into HER2-negative and HER2-positive groups and chisquare test was used to compare the demographics. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to remove confounding factors. The log-rank test was used to compare the overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the effects of different variables on the prognosis of MBC patients. Subgroup analysis was conducted by using R software to explore the benefit of OS and DSS in the subgroup of MBC patients. Results: In the matched cohort, the log-rank test showed that there was a longer OS (P=0.044) in the HER2-negative group, and the 4-year OS rate in HER2-negative patients was significantly improved (P=0.008), but there was no difference in the DSS (P=0.408) and the 4-year DSS rates (P=0.198) between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression also showed that the HER2 status did not independently associate with DSS (P=0.444). Subgroup analysis showed that HER2-negative patients experienced a longer OS in the subgroup of tumors 2-4 cm in size, no distant metastasis and who had received radiotherapy, but none of subgroup was found a significant difference in DSS between different HER2 status. Conclusion: This study identified that HER2 status had a clear influence on OS in patients with MBC, and there was a longer OS and a higher 4-year OS rate in the HER2-negative group. In addition, we observed that HER2 status had no significant effect on DSS in patients with MBC. © 2019 Chen et al.},

	abstract = {Women diagnosed with breast cancer at young age often have poorprognoses. Yet, few studies have focused on the prognoses of young men with breast cancer. We therefore used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based data and identified 151 male patients with breast cancer aged <40 years between 1988 and 2012. Propensity score matching analysis was used to balance the clinical variables among different groups. Kaplan–Meier curves were applied to compare the survival differences. The subgroup variables on cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazard model. Results showed that male patients with breast cancer aged <40 had a significant OS benefit compared with those aged ≥40 years (P < .001). The significant difference of the CSS was not found (P > .05). Compared with the male patients with breast cancer aged ≥40, those aged <40 had significant OS benefit in most subgroups (P < .05). Compared with the female patients with breast cancer aged <40, the male patients with breast cancer aged <40 had worse OS and CSS benefit only in the subgroup with progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor positive (P < .05). In conclusion, we demonstrated that young male patients with breast cancer had better OS compared with elder male patients with breast cancer. However, the survival benefit was not found compared with young female patients with breast cancer. Copyright © 2018 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

	abstract = {Important differences have begun to emerge concerning the molecular profile of female and male breast cancer which may prove to be of therapeutic value. This review examined all the available data on the genomics of MBC. Most male cancers are ER+ve but without a corresponding increase in PR positivity and only a weaker association with estrogen-controlled markers such as PS2, HSP27 and Cathepsin-D. HER2 +ve cancers are rare in males and the role of androgen receptor is controversial. Although the Luminal A phenotype was the most frequent in both MBC and FBC, no Luminal B or HER2 phenotypes were found in males and the basal phenotype was very rare. Using hierarchical clustering in FBC, ERα clustered with PR, whereas in MBC, ERα associated with ERβ and AR. Based on limited data it appears that Oncotype DX is effective in determining recurrence risk in selected MBC. In future, tailored therapies based on genomics will probably yield the most promising approach for both MBC and FBC. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease that occurs in ~0.2% of all neoplasms among men. The risk of developing MBC is higher in men with a BRCA2 genetic mutation (7%). The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between c.2808_2811del ACAA (p.Ala938Profs) BRCA2 mutation in MBC and clinicopathological factors. A 75-year-old patient was admitted to the Genetic Outpatient Clinic with a diagnosis of right breast cancer and with a family history of cancer (two daughters who were diagnosed with breast cancer at ages 46 and 38 years). Postoperative histopathological examination revealed tumor type pT2 N1a Mx, NST NG-3 G-3, Ki-67 (75%), HER2 (+), ER (+++), PR (+++), invasive carcinoma and luminal B subtype. The complete coding sequences of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were analyzed for genomic DNA material using next generation sequencing on the Ion Torrent platform. The c.2808_2811delACAA (p.Ala938Profs) mutation was observed in the BRCA2 gene. The presence of the c.2808_2811delACAA (p.Ala938Profs) mutation in the BRCA2 gene was confirmed using the Sanger method. The same BRCA2 gene mutation was reported in one of the patient’s daughters. The detected mutation causes the frameshift mutation, resulting in the creation of an additional translation termination codon and the synthesis of an abnormal protein. This mutation was associated with a later age of disease, a higher histological degree, a higher mitotic index, a positive steroid receptor status and the luminal B subtype HER2- breast cancer. © 2019 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

	abstract = {Background: Guidelines for radiotherapy in male breast cancer (MBC) are lacking. Some extrapolate the results from female breast cancer trials, while others advocate systematic adjuvant irradiation. We evaluated clinical practices and outcomes with respect to radiation therapy in MBC treated with locoregional irradiation in the adjuvant setting using a systematic literature review. Material and Methods: We included studies with data about adjuvant radiotherapy published between 1984 and 2017 and including at least 40 patients. Results: We found 29 retrospective series, 10,065 men were diagnosed with breast cancer; 3-100% (mean=54%) received adjuvant radiotherapy. Tumor size and nodal involvement were the strongest prognostic factors. Approximatively half of all cases had nodal metastases. Radiation therapy improved locoregional control in six series, overall survival in three and distant metastasis-free survival in one. Conclusion: MBC is diagnosed at a highly advanced stage and may be linked with poorer outcomes. Adjuvant radiation therapy must, at least, be proposed to men with positive nodes. Despite the large number of cases gathered here, arguments for radiotherapy in other prognostic subgroups (especially in pN0) may exist but are not well supported.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare and consequently understudied. Here we present the case of contralateral breast cancer in a male patient nearly a quarter century following his initial breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. The epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, characterization, treatment, and prognosis of male breast cancer are reviewed. MBC accounts for <1% of all breast cancer with an estimated incidence nearly 1.25 per 100,000 person years. Our patient tested positive for ATM mutation of undetermined significance. More commonly in males, a BRCA2 mutation confers a >1 in 15 lifetime risk of breast cancer and is present in >11% of MBC patients, while BRCA1 is present in an estimated <1.5% of MBC patients. The risk of contralateral breast cancer developing in a male with a unilateral lesion is much higher than for a primary male breast cancer in the general population. Men tend to be diagnosed at a later age and stage than females. Prognosis for male and female breast cancer is similar considering both age of patient and stage of the tumor at diagnosis, and similar treatment paradigms have resulted in similar outcomes. Although lumpectomy with radiation therapy may have the same prognosis as mastectomy, the standard of care for male breast cancer continues to be simple mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2019.

	abstract = {Purpose: Genomic assays, or tissue gene profiling tests, are widely used to predict recurrence of early stage invasive breast cancer and guide systemic therapy. The purpose of our study was to examine the current national trends of genomic testing in male breast cancer (MBC) and its association with systemic therapy. Materials and Methods: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) includes 6227 cases of pathologic T1/T2 and N0/N1 MBC from 2008 to 2014 with known genomic testing status. Results of the tests were grouped as low, intermediate, and high risk of recurrence scores (RRS). Statistical analysis included multivariate logistic regression and Chi-square tests. A supplemental analysis in female breast cancer was provided as reference. Results: Of the 6227 cases of MBC age 18-90, 1478 (23.74%) underwent genomic testing. Testing was significantly associated with age, race, tumor grade, year of diagnosis, receptor status, and nodal status. Distribution of RRS in MBC was 59.3% low, 27.4% intermediate, and 13.3% high. RRS in men were significantly associated with tumor grade and size, but not nodal status. Those with a low RRS were 7-times more likely to be treated with hormone therapy alone (AOR 7.18, CI 5.78-8.91, P < 0.001). Those with a high RRS were five times more likely to receive a combination of hormone and chemotherapy (AOR 5.16, CI 3.60-7.40, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Rates of testing and distribution of RRS in men and women with early stage invasive breast cancer are similar. Treatment patterns in MBC varied significantly based on genomic testing results, even when adjusted for other clinicopathologic features. Further investigation is required to determine the prognostic and predictive nature of genomic testing in male breast cancer. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Methods: Using the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we compared the demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcome of estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive (ER+/PR+) patients with ER+/PR- male breast cancer patients from 1990 to 2010. Two thousand three hundred twenty-two patients with ER+/PR+ tumors and 355 patients with ER+/PR- tumors were included in our study. Results: ER+/PR- patients were younger (P = 0.008) and more likely to be African American (P < 0.001) while presented with higher histological grade (P < 0.001), larger tumor size (P = 0.010), and more invasion to the lymph nodes (P = 0.034) and distant sites (P < 0.001), thus later stage (P = 0.001). Despite higher chance of receiving chemotherapy (51.0% vs 36.5%, P < 0.001), ER+/PR- patients experienced significantly worse breast cancer-specific survival (BSCC) (P < 0.001) and shorter overall survival (OS) (P = 0.003). Multivariate Cox model confirmed that tumor size, lymph node invasion, metastasis, and surgery were independent prognostic factors of both BSCC and OS for ER+/PR- male breast cancer. Age at diagnosis and chemotherapy were significantly associated with OS but not with BSCC. Conclusion: ER+/PR- male breast cancer was more aggressive and experienced shorter survival than ER+/PR+ patients.

Determine all-cause mortality compared to the general male population and analyze survival/mortality compared with Danish female breast cancer patients (FBCP) in the same period. Material and methods: The MBCP cohort was defined from three national registers. Data was extracted from medical journals. Data for FBCP is from the DBCG database. Overall survival (OS) was quantified by Kaplan–Meier estimates. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated based on mortality rate among patients relative to the mortality rate in the general population. The association between SMR and risk factors were analyzed in univariate and multivariable Poisson regression models. Separate models for each gender were used for the analyses. Results: We found a marked difference in OS for the two genders. For the total population of MBCP, 5- and 10-year survivals were 55.1% and 31.7%, respectively. For FBCP, the corresponding figures were 76.8% and 59.3%. Median age at diagnosis for FBCP was 61 years and 70 years for MBCP. By applying SMR, the difference in mortality between genders equalized and showed pronounced age-dependency. For males <40 years, SMR was 9.43 and for females 19.56 compared to SMR for males 80 + years (0.95) and females 80 + years (0.89). During the period 1980–2009, the risk of dying gradually decreased for FBCP (p <.0001). The risk 1980–1984 was 35% higher than 2005–2009 (RR 1.35). Although the risk of dying for MBCP was also lowest in 2005–2009, there was no clear tendency (p =.1439). The risk was highest in 1990–1994 (RR =2.48). Conclusion: We found better OS for FBCP than for MBCP. But SMR showed similar mortality rate for the two genders, except for very young FBCP, who had higher SMR. Furthermore, significantly improved survival over time for FBCP was observed, with no clear tendency for MBCP. © 2017 Acta Oncologica Foundation.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare cancer entity, with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes accounting for ~ 10% of patients. Multiple-gene sequencing has already entered clinical practice for female breast cancer, whereas the performance of panel testing in MBC has not been studied extensively. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of panel testing for MBC, by the largest gene panel used so far, through investigation of patients deriving from a population with known founder effects. Methods: Genomic DNA from one hundred and two Greek MBC patients, unselected for age and family history, was used to prepare libraries which capture the entire coding regions of 94 cancer genes. Results: Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations were found in 12.7% of the cases, distributed in six genes: BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, CHEK2, PMS2, and FANCL. BRCA2 mutations were the most frequent, followed by ATM mutations, accounting for 6.9 and 2%, respectively, while mutations in other genes were detected in single cases. Age at diagnosis or family history was not predictive of mutation status. Beyond mutations in established breast cancer predisposing genes, LoF mutations in PMS2 and FANCL among MBC patients are reported here for the first time. Conclusions: Our findings, using the largest gene panel for MBC patients so far, indicate that BRCA testing should be the primary concern for MBC patients. Until sufficient evidence arises from larger studies, multiple-gene panels may be of limited benefit for MBC and their families, at least for MBC patients of specific descent. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) management is extrapolated from female BC. Mastectomy remains the most frequently used surgical procedure for male breast cancer (MBC). We performed a literature review to assess the use of breast-conservation (BCS) in MBC as well as outcomes following BCS. Methods: A systematic literature was performed, and articles screened to identify studies that measured overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), or local recurrence (LR) in patients undergoing BCS. Weighted averages based on study size were performed for LR, DFS, and 5-year OS. Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria with male breast surgery cases, and 859 (14.7%) underwent BCS. The mean follow-up time was 53 months, and mean age was 62.6 years, with stage II as the most common presentation. Two studies reported that 50–71.4% of patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, and four studies reported axillary lymph node dissection in 14.3–100%. Five studies reported on adjuvant radiation therapy in 12.0–100% of total patients undergoing BCS. Four studies reported use of hormonal therapy in 73.8–100% of patients. Four studies reported use of chemotherapy in 25–66.7% of patients. Seven studies reported LR among 116 patients, with a weighted average of 9.9%. Three studies reported on DFS in 14 patients, with a weighted average 85.6%. Two studies report OS in 143 patients with a weighted average of 84.4%. Conclusions: Breast conservation may be considered a safe alternative in the surgical treatment of MBC. Future research should focus on better standardization of local therapy for MBC and improved reporting of outcomes. © 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Male breast cancer (BC) is rare, representing approximately 1% of cancers that occur in men and approximately 1% of all BCs worldwide. Because male BC is rare, not much is known about the disease, and treatment recommendations are typically extrapolated from data available from clinical trials enrolling female BC patients. Methods: We review the epidemiology, risk factors, prognosis, and the varied molecular and clinicopathologic features that characterize male BC. In addition, we summarize the available data for the use of systemic therapy in the treatment of male BC and explore the ongoing development of targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this subgroup of BCs. Results: There are important biological differences between male and female BC. Male BC is almost exclusively hormone receptor positive (+), including the androgen receptor (AR), and is associated with an increased prevalence of BRCA2 germline mutations, especially in men with increased risk for developing high-risk BC. Additional research is warranted to better characterize male BC. To accomplish this, a multi-national consortium approach, such as the International Male Breast Cancer Program, is needed in response to the scarcity of patients. This approach allows the pooling of information from a large number of men with BC and the creation of registries for future therapeutic-focused clinical trials. Conclusions: Given the unique biology of BC in men, promising new therapeutic targets are currently under investigation, including the use of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors or AR-targeted agents either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer can occur in either gender; however, it is rare in men, accounting for <1% of diagnosed cases. In a previous transcriptomic screen of male breast cancer (MBC) and female breast cancer (FBC) occurrences, we observed that Stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) was overexpressed in the former. The aim of this study was to confirm the expression of STC2 in MBC and to investigate whether this had an impact on patient prognosis. Following an earlier transcriptomic screen, STC2 gene expression was confirmed by RT-qPCR in matched MBC and FBC samples as well as in tumour-associated fibroblasts derived from each gender. Subsequently, STC2 protein expression was examined immunohistochemically in tissue microarrays containing 477 MBC cases. Cumulative survival probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and multivariate survival analysis was performed using the Cox hazard model. Gender-specific STC2 gene expression showed a 5.6-fold upregulation of STC2 transcripts in MBC, also supported by data deposited in Oncomine™. STC2 protein expression was a positive prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS; Log-rank; total p = 0.035, HR = 0.49; tumour cells p = 0.017, HR = 0.44; stroma p = 0.030, HR = 0.48) but had no significant impact on overall survival (Log-rank; total p = 0.23, HR = 0.71; tumour cells p = 0.069, HR = 0.59; stroma p = 0.650, HR = 0.87). Importantly, multivariate analysis adjusted for patient age at diagnosis, node staging, tumour size, ER, and PR status revealed that total STC2 expression as well as expression in tumour cells was an independent prognostic factor for DFS (Cox regression; p = 0.018, HR = 0.983; p = 0.015, HR = 0.984, respectively). In conclusion, STC2 expression is abundant in MBC where it is an independent prognostic factor for DFS. © 2018 The Authors.

Four male breast cancer patients belonging to different families were recruited from Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot, India. A total of 51 genes reported with implications in the pathogenesis of breast cancer were screened using next generation sequencing. Germline variations were found in BRCA1, BRCA2, PMS2, p53, and PALB2 genes, previously reported to be associated with MBC as well as FBC. In addition to these, 13 novel missense alterations were detected in eight genes including STK11, FZR1, PALB2, BRCA2, NF2, BAP1, BARD1, and CHEK2. Impact of these missense alterations on structure and function of protein was also analyzed through molecular dynamics simulation.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for approximately 1% of all breast cancers, limiting the data characterizing clinicopathologic features and treatment outcomes in patients with MBC. This paucity of data has led to most of our treatment guidance being extrapolated from patients with female breast cancer (FBC). From 1998 to 2012, data were captured using the National Cancer Database to identify patients with nonmetastatic MBC (n = 23 305) and FBC (n = 2 678 061). Tumor and clinicopathologic features were obtained and compared. Patients with MBC were more likely to have invasive disease, T2-4 tumors, centrally located tumors, positive lymph nodes, estrogen receptor–positive or progesterone receptor–positive tumors, lymphovascular space invasion, and were less likely to have Her2/neu-positive or triple-negative tumors. All of these differences were statistically significant (P <.001). Treatment comparisons showed that patients with MBC were more likely to undergo mastectomy and less likely to undergo breast-conserving surgery with postoperative radiation utilization found to be less in patients with MBC, both as part of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and for postmastectomy radiation treatment (PMRT) (P <.001). Stage-by-stage comparisons showed that median survival, 5-year, and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates are lower in patients with MBC vs patients with FBC (P <.001). The utilization of adjuvant radiation, both BCT and PMRT, was shown to improve 5- and 10-year OS (P <.001). Male breast cancer clinicopathologic features appear to be unfavorable in relation to FBC and adjuvant radiation is shown beneficial in survival outcomes. Further investigation is needed to help guide future utilization and treatment with radiation, systemic, and endocrine manipulation in this small population of patients with MBC. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare malignancy, and gender-specific treatment outcomes are currently lacking. The use of a large, multi-national surgical-outcomes database may provide a better understanding of treatment patterns and postoperative morbidity in men who undergo oncological breast surgery. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted between 2007 and 2016 using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (NSQIP), examining MBC treatment patterns and postoperative complication rates. All men undergoing surgery for the treatment of invasive or in situ carcinoma of the breast were identified. Clinical characteristics, demographics, and surgical treatment options most frequently used for this population were described. In addition, the 30-day postoperative complication rates in the surgical treatment of male breast cancer were evaluated. Results: A total of 1773 MBC patients with a median age of 65 years (IQR 56–74 years) were included in this analysis. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 29.1 (IQR 25.4–33.8). In this study population, 177 (10.0%) had a diagnosis of in situ breast cancer, while the remaining 1596 (90.0%) had invasive disease. While most men underwent mastectomy, 282 (15.9%) had breast-conserving surgery. There were 74 (4.2%) patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction. In addition, 118 (6.7%) patients elected to have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Overall, the rate of morbidity was 4.6%, comprising mostly of wound complications (3.2%). Conclusion: Analysis of this large, prospective multi-institutional cohort revealed that complication rates are low and comparable to reported rates in the female breast cancer population. What is also significant about this analysis is that the cohort demonstrated the importance of cosmetic considerations in MBC patients, as some men decide to undergo breast-conserving surgery or immediate breast reconstruction. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in the treatment of MBC is also performed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

FromFebruary 2009 to January 2012, our SLN biopsy database was retrospectively reviewed to identify male breast cancer cases. Of the 890 SLN procedures contained in the database, 10 male breast cancer patients were identified. Patient age, body mass index, SLN biopsy technique, SLN identification, number of SLN excised, and pathology reports were reviewed. Mean age was 57.2 (34-85) years with a mean tumor size was 2.2 (1.0-4.0) cm. SLN detection ratios were two in four with blue dye and six in six with the combination technique. Overall, SLNs were identified in 8 of the 10 patients. SLN biopsy is applicable in male breast cancer cases.

	abstract = {Introduction Breast cancer (BC) in men is a rare disease, whose etiology appears to be associated with genetic factors. Inherited mutations in BRCA1/2 genes account for about 10–15% of all cases. FANCM, functionally linked to BRCA1/2, has been suggested as a novel BC susceptibility gene. Our aim was to test if FANCM germline mutations could further explain male BC (MBC) susceptibility. Methods We screened the entire coding region of FANCM in 286 MBCs by a multi-gene panel analysis, and compared these data with available whole exome sequencing data from 415 men used as population controls. Moreover, we genotyped the two most frequent FANCM mutations (c.5101C>T and c.5791C>T) in 506 MBCs and 854 healthy male controls. Results Two FANCM truncating mutations, the c.1432C>T (p.Arg478Ter) and c.1972C>T (p.Arg658Ter), were identified in two MBC cases (0.7%). When specifically considering cases at increased genetic risk for BC, FANCM mutation frequency raises up to 1%. One mutation, the c.2201_2202delCT (p.Ser734Terfs), was found among controls (0.24%). Mutation frequency in cases was higher than in controls, however this difference was not statistically significant. FANCM c.5101C>T was not present in any of the cases and controls analyzed, whereas FANCM c.5791C>T was found in two controls (0.23%). Conclusion Rare FANCM truncating mutations, other than c.5101C>T and c.5791C>T, may have a role in MBC susceptibility. The inclusion of FANCM in gene panels for research purpose would allow for the identification of a higher number of mutation carriers, thus helping estimate BC risk associated with FANCM mutations. © 2017},

Studies validating RS are limited to women. Our objective was to assess RS distribution and factors associated with high-risk RS in male BC. Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we identified men and women with ER+/HER2− BC from 2010 to 2013. Patients were categorized into risk groups using the traditional and the Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (TAILORx) cutoffs. Multivariable logistic regression determined factors associated with testing and high-risk TAILORx RS. Results: We identified 1388 men and 154,196 women with ER+/HER2− BC. Twenty-five percent of men and 30% of women had RS testing. Mean age of tested men was 63; most were white (81%), had grade I or II tumors (67%), and had stage I or II (95%) BC. Factors associated with increased RS testing were younger age, recent year of diagnosis, lymph node negativity, and lower-stage tumors (p ≤ 0.05). By TAILORx, 21% of men had high-risk RS compared with 14% of tested women. Men with grade III and PR negative tumors were more likely to have a high-risk RS (p ≤ 0.05). Chemotherapy utilization was correlated with RS. Conclusions: Using a large population-based dataset, we found that compared with women, men were significantly more likely to have high-risk RS. Grade III and PR-negative BC were significantly associated with high-risk RS. Higher RS in men correlated with increased chemotherapy utilization. © 2018, Society of Surgical Oncology.},

As concordant male breast cancers are utterly rare, discordant associations of male breast cancer with other cancers may reveal genetic and possible environmental risk factors contributing to male breast cancer susceptibility. Methods: We calculated relative risks (RRs) for male breast cancer in families with discordant cancers, and conversely, for discordant cancers in families of male breast cancer patients, based on 15.7 million individuals in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. Results: Among 1428 male breast cancer patients, 16.2% had a female relative diagnosed with breast cancer. Ovarian and female anal cancers showed the strongest associations with male breast cancer (p value < 0.0005). The other significant associations included colorectal, small intestinal, and thyroid cancers, cancer of unknown primary and non-Hodgkin lymphoma but these were each based on a single positive association with male breast cancer. The RRs for male breast cancer were increased in families in which multiple patients were diagnosed with diverse cancers, reaching an RR of 2.58 when three or more family members were affected. Conclusions: The results suggest that male breast cancer shares susceptibility with a number of other cancers but confirmation is needed in other datasets. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian log-linear models for Poisson-distributed response data, especially Besag, York and Mollié (BYM) model, are widely used for disease mapping. In some cases, due to the high proportion of zero, Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson models are applied for disease mapping. This study proposes a Bayesian spatial joint model of Bernoulli distribution and Poisson distribution to map disease count data with excessive zeros. Here, the spatial random effect is simultaneously considered into both logistic and log-linear models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. In addition, we focus on the BYM2 model, a re-parameterization of the common BYM model, with penalized complexity priors for the latent level modeling in the joint model and zero-inflated Poisson models with different type of zeros. To avoid model fitting and convergence issues, Bayesian inferences are implemented using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method. The models are compared according to the deviance information criterion and the logarithmic scoring. A simulation study with different proportions of zero exhibits INLA ability in running the models and also shows slight differences between the popular BYM and BYM2 models in terms of model choice criteria. In an application, we apply the fitting models on male breast cancer data in Iran at county level in 2014. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MaBC) is a rare disease, accounting for less than 1% of malignancies in men. For this reason, literature data on its clinicopathological characteristics are very heterogeneous and treatment strategies have mostly been extrapolated from the female counterpart. However, immunohistochemical peculiarities of MaBC have recently emerged, defining it as a distinct entity from female breast cancer (FBC), thus requiring a tailored clinical approach. MaBC appears to be more often hormone receptor positive than FBC, while data on HER2 status still remain inconclusive, indicating a possible higher incidence of HER2 alterations. Treatment strategies for MaBC have evolved and less invasive local treatments such as lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy have become part of everyday clinical practice, while there are still controversies on the indication of radiotherapy, especially after mastectomy. Similarly, differences between male and female hormonal status have raised some concerns in the use of aromatase inhibitors in male patients and the choice of best endocrine therapy is still controversial. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cancers arising in the male breast are uncommon. Male breast cancer is a hormone-driven disease that often expresses the estrogen receptor, and antiestrogen therapy represents the mainstay of treatment. Paradoxically, the advent of a wave of antiestrogens eclipsed the therapeutic potential of alternative therapeutic options. At the beginning of the hormonal therapy era the administration of antiandrogens to metastatic male breast cancer patients was proposed. Ever since the use of these compounds has largely been neglected. A therapeutic role for antiandrogens has been envisioned again in recent years. First, molecular characterization efforts pointed to the androgen receptor as a potential therapeutic target. Second, the development of aromatase inhibitors unexpectedly raised the need for neutralizing androgens in order to tackle endocrine feedback mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance. We herein provide an overview of molecular studies where the androgen receptor was investigated at the genomic, transcriptomic or phenotypic level. We then discuss androgens in the context of the endocrine networks nourishing male breast cancer. Finally, clinical evidence on antiandrogens is summarized along with strategies should be implemented to improve the medical management of these patients. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and lacks data-based treatment guidelines. Most men are currently treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM) or simple mastectomy (SM). We compared the oncologic treatment outcomes of early-stage MBC to determine whether breast conservation therapy (BCT) is appropriate. Materials and Methods We searched the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for MBC cases. That cohort was narrowed to cases of stage I-II, T1-T2N0 MBC with surgical and radiation therapy (RT) data available. The patients had undergone MRM, SM, or breast conservation surgery (BCS) with or without postoperative RT. We calculated the actuarial 5-year cause-specific survival (CSS). Results We identified 6263 MBC cases and included 1777 men with stage I or II, T1-T2, node-negative disease, who had the required treatment information available. MRM without RT was the most common treatment (43%). Only 17% underwent BCS. Of the BCS patients, 46% received adjuvant RT to complete the traditional BCT. No deaths were recorded in the BCT group, regardless of stage, or in the 3 stage I surgical groups if the men had received RT. The actuarial 5-year CSS was 100% in each BCT group. MRM alone resulted in an actuarial 5-year CSS of 97.3% for stage 1% and 91.2% for stage 2. Conclusion The results from our study suggest that BCT for early-stage MBC yields comparable survival compared with more invasive treatment modalities (ie, MRM or SM alone). This could shift the treatment paradigm to less-invasive interventions and might have the added benefit of increased functional and psychological outcomes. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our conclusions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 pathways are central in DNA damage repair (DDR) and their over-activation may confer aggressive molecular features, being an adaptive response to endogenous DNA damage and oncogene-induced replication stress. Herein we investigated the ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 signalings in male breast cancer (MBC). The expression of DDR kinases (pATR, pATM, pChk1, pChk2, and pWee1) and DNA damage markers (pRPA32 and γ-H2AX) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 289 MBC samples to assess their association. Survival analyses were carried out in 112 patients. Survival curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. Cox proportional regression models were generated to identify variables impacting survival outcomes. The expression of pATR conferred poorer survival outcomes (log rank p = 0.013, p = 0.007 and p = 0.010 for overall, 15-and 10-year survival, respectively). Multivariate Cox models of 10-year survival and overall indicated that pATR expression, alone or combined with pChk2, was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes (10-year survival: pATR: HR 2.74, 95% CI: 1.23-6.10; pATR/pChk2: HR 2.92, 95% CI: 1.35-6.33; overall survival: pATR: HR 2.58, 95% CI: 1.20-5.53; pATR/pChk2: HR 2.89, 95% CI: 1.37-6.12). Overall, the ATR/ATM-initiated molecular cascade seems to be active in a fraction of MBC patients and may represent a negative prognostic factor. © 2017 The Author(s).},

Results: CHEK2 c.1100delC mutation was found in 4 patients (5.9%), which is significantly more frequent than in the control population (OR: 4.47, 95% CI 1.51-13.18, p = 0.019). Four CHEK2 I157T variants were also detected, but the frequency did not significantly differ from population controls (p = 0.781). No RAD51C, RAD51D, PALB2, or FANCM mutations were found.

In the United Kingdom, female breast cancer following occupational radiation exposure is among that set of cancers eligible for state compensation and consideration is currently being given to an extension to include male breast cancer. Objectives: We compare radiation-associated excess relative and absolute risks of male and female breast cancers. Methods: Breast cancer incidence and mortality data in the Japanese atomic-bomb survivors were analyzed using relative and absolute risk models via Poisson regression. Results: We observed significant (p ≤ 0.01) dose-related excess risk for male breast cancer incidence and mortality. For incidence and mortality data, there are elevations by factors of approximately 15 and 5, respectively, of relative risk for male compared with female breast cancer incidence, the former borderline significant (p = 0.050). In contrast, for incidence and mortality data, there are elevations by factors of approximately 20 and 10, respectively, of female absolute risk compared with male, both statistically significant (p < 0.001). There are no indications of differences between the sexes in age/time-since-exposure/age-at-exposure modifications to the relative or absolute excess risk. The probability of causation of male breast cancer following radiation exposure exceeds by at least a factor of 5 that of many other malignancies. Conclusions: There is evidence of much higher radiation-associated relative risk for male than for female breast cancer, although absolute excess risks for males are much less than for females. However, the small number of male cases and deaths suggests a degree of caution in interpretation of this finding. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The present study obtained retrospective clinicopathological data, treatment patterns and outcomes for all male patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the Oncology Department, Faculty Hospital Trenčín (Trenčín, Slovakia) over the last 20 years from January 1995 to December 2015. A total of 21 patients with male breast cancer were analyzed, with a median patient age of 65.6 years. Two patients were diagnosed with lobular invasive cancer; all others were diagnosed with cancer of a ductal origin. One patient presented with metastatic disease in the pleural cavity. The primary tumors in 8 patients were staged as pT1, whilst 6 patients were staged as pT2 and 7 as pT4. Axillary lymph node involvement was present in 11 patients (52%) and 15 patients were hormone receptor-positive (83%). All but 1 patient underwent mastectomy and surgical staging of the axilla. Adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment was administered in the same manner as breast cancer treatment in female patients. The median follow-up time was 4.5 years. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 87 and 74%, respectively, and the estimated median disease-free survival for the same population was 9.5 years (95% confidence interval, 6.2-14.6). The survival rates reported in the present retrospective study are comparable with previously published studies. In addition, the current study reported predominant hormone-positive characteristics and rare expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease whose etiology appears to be largely associated with genetic factors. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for about 10% of all MBC cases. Thus, a fraction of MBC cases are expected to be due to genetic factors not yet identified. To further explain the genetic susceptibility for MBC, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and targeted gene sequencing were applied to high-risk, BRCA1/2 mutation–negative MBC cases. METHODS: Germ-line DNA of 1 male and 2 female BRCA1/2 mutation–negative breast cancer (BC) cases from a pedigree showing a first-degree family history of MBC was analyzed with WES. Targeted gene sequencing for the validation of WES results was performed for 48 high-risk, BRCA1/2 mutation–negative MBC cases from an Italian multicenter study of MBC. A case-control series of 433 BRCA1/2 mutation–negative MBC and female breast cancer (FBC) cases and 849 male and female controls was included in the study. RESULTS: WES in the family identified the partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) c.419delA truncating mutation carried by the proband, her father, and her paternal uncle (all affected with BC) and the N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) c.97C>T nonsense mutation carried by the proband's maternal aunt. Targeted PALB2 sequencing detected the c.1984A>T nonsense mutation in 1 of the 48 BRCA1/2 mutation–negative MBC cases. NAT1 c.97C>T was not found in the case-control series. CONCLUSIONS: These results add strength to the evidence showing that PALB2 is involved in BC risk for both sexes and indicate that consideration should be given to clinical testing of PALB2 for BRCA1/2 mutation–negative families with multiple MBC and FBC cases.

	abstract = {Background Male breast cancer (BC) is a kind of rare tumour. There were few researches concerning the effect of chemotherapy for it. The purpose of this study is to estimate the value of chemotherapy on prognosis in male BC. Patients and methods Complete clinical and pathological information of male BC were collected from January 1990 to January 2008 in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital in China. 134 cases of male BC were included for analysis and separated into two groups based on receiving chemotherapy or not receiving chemotherapy. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) between chemotherapy group and non-chemotherapy group were compared with Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Stratified analysis was used to evaluate the strength of the association between chemotherapy and each risk factor. Multivariate analysis was conducted by using COX proportional hazard regression model. Results There were 58.21% (78/134) cases who underwent chemotherapy and 41.79% (56/134) cases without chemotherapy. There were 20 cases (25.64%) with recurrence/metastasis in patients with chemotherapy and six cases (10.71%) in patients without chemotherapy. The mean DFS time of male BC with chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy is 150.87 and 154.13 months, respectively (‡ 2 =3.825, p=0.050). The mean OS time of male BC with chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy is 155.33 and 154.26 months, respectively (‡ 2 =2.542, p=0.111). COX proportional hazard regression model showed that the two groups had similar DFS (HR=0.386, p=0.165), while chemotherapy might be a protective fact on OS (HR=0.140, p=0.026). Conclusion The utility of chemotherapy should be considered in the high risk level of recurrence/metastasis in male BC. © European Society for Medical Oncology (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

	abstract = {Background: The local-regional management of female breast cancer has been extensively investigated worldwide. The optimal approach for males diagnosed with breast cancer is less clear. We have analyzed the treatment of male breast cancer using a population-based national registry to determine the impact of surgery and radiation therapy on survival. Materials and Methods: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was queried to identify males with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast who underwent primary surgical resection (radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, total mastectomy, or segmental) for the years 1983 to 2002. Demographic, clinical, and pathologic data were culled and analyzed to determine the impact of radiation therapy (RT) following resection. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and significance was determined using the log-rank test (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model was performed to determine factors significant for overall (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS). Results: A total of 1337 patients met the eligibility criteria and were analyzed. Median follow-up was 7.3 years (range, 1 mo to 25 y). Most men underwent modified radical mastectomy (n=1062) with a minority undergoing segmental (n=113). About 329 men received postoperative external beam RT. The median rates of OS and CSS for all men were 10.5 years and not yet reached, respectively. The surgical procedure did not significantly associate with OS or CSS. By stage, RT was associated with improved OS for stage I (P=0.03). There was a trend for improved survival with stage II (P=0.21) and III (P=0.15). RT was not associated with improved CSS by stage. RT improved rates of OS and CSS in N2 patients without reaching statistical significance (P=0.10 and 0.22). On multivariate analysis, advancing age, stage and grade, and no postoperative RT predicted for worse OS. However, when controlled for those with known hormone receptor status (n=978), only the factors of advancing age, stage, grade, and hormone receptor negativity predicted for worse OS. Advancing age, stage, and grade were the only predictors of CSS irrespective of the cohort analyzed. Conclusions: The primary surgical procedure did not ultimately influence OS or CSS in this population-based registry of males with breast cancer. A statistically nonsignificant improvement with postoperative RT was observed in men with lymph node involvement, larger tumor size, or higher stage. When controlled for age, stage, and grade in multivariate analysis, postoperative RT predicted for improved OS but not CSS. These data suggest a beneficial effect of RT in the postoperative setting. A prospective study is necessary to further elucidate appropriate treatment strategies for men with breast cancer. Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Results: Most common stage at presentation in our study was in stage II. The median follow up was 32.75 months. The actuarial 5-year survival was 92.30% and DFS was 76.30%. Only hormone receptor status was found as a significant prognostic variable among the prognostic factors studied for disease free survival. Conclusions: Carcinoma breast in male is a relatively rare disease and management principles are translated from our understanding of breast cancer in women. A relatively early stage at presentation is a contrasting finding of our series which may be responsible for a significantly better actuarial 5 year survival rates. © 2017 The South Asian Journal of Cancer | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

Methods: We retrospectively identified 130 MBC cases from 2004 to 2013. Intrinsic molecular subtypes were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: From a total of 130 MBC cases, 45.4% of tumors were luminal A subtype, 44.6% were luminal B, 5% were HER2 positive and 5% were triple negative tumors. There were statistically significant differences between different IHC intrinsic subtypes regarding tumor size (p=0.001), estrogen receptor (ER) status (p=0.001), progesterone receptor (PR) status (p=0.001), HER2 status (p=0.001) and Ki67 proliferation index (p=0.001).

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer is rare and treatment is based on data from females. High expression/activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) denotes a poor prognosis in female breast cancer, and the eIF4E pathway has been targeted therapeutically. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E activity in female breast cancer is deregulated by eIF4E overexpression and by phosphorylation of its binding protein, 4E-BP1, which relieves inhibitory association between eIF4E and 4E-BP1. The relevance of the eIF4E pathway in male breast cancer is unknown. Methods: We have assessed expression levels of eIF4E, 4E-BP1, 4E-BP2 and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p4E-BP1) using immunohistochemistry in a large cohort of male breast cancers (n=337) and have examined correlations with prognostic factors and survival. Results: Neither eIF4E expression nor estimated eIF4E activity were associated with prognosis. However, a highly significant correlation was found between p4E-BP1 expression and disease-free survival (DFS), linking any detectable p4E-BP1 with poor survival (univariate log rank P=0.001; multivariate HR 8.8, P=0.0001). Conclusions: Our data provide no support for direct therapeutic targeting of eIF4E in male breast cancer, unlike in females. However, as p4E-BP1 gives powerful prognostic insights that are unrelated to eIF4E function, p4E-BP1 may identify male breast cancers potentially suitable for therapies directed at the upstream kinase, mTOR. © 2016 Cancer Research UK.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Breast cancer affects both genders, but is understudied in men. Although still rare, male breast cancer (MBC) is being diagnosed more frequently. Treatments are wholly informed by clinical studies conducted in women, based on assumptions that underlying biology is similar. Experimental Design: A transcriptomic investigation of male and female breast cancer was performed, confirming transcriptomic data in silico. Biomarkers were immunohistochemically assessed in 697 MBCs (n = 477, training; n = 220, validation set) and quantified in pre- and posttreatment samples from an MBC patient receiving everolimus and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. Results: Gender-specific gene expression patterns were identified. eIF transcripts were upregulated in MBC. eIF4E and eIF5 were negatively prognostic for overall survival alone (log-rank P = 0.013; HR = 1.77, 1.12-2.8 and P = 0.035; HR = 1.68, 1.03-2.74, respectively), or when coexpressed (P = 0.01; HR = 2.66, 1.26-5.63), confirmed in the validation set. This remained upon multivariate Cox regression analysis [eIF4E P = 0.016; HR = 2.38 (1.18-4.8), eIF5 P = 0.022; HR = 2.55 (1.14-5.7); coexpression P = 0.001; HR = 7.04 (2.22-22.26)]. Marked reduction in eIF4E and eIF5 expression was seen post BEZ235/everolimus, with extended survival. Conclusions: Translational initiation pathway inhibition could be of clinical utility in MBC patients overexpressing eIF4E and eIF5. With mTOR inhibitors that target this pathway now in the clinic, these biomarkers may represent new targets for therapeutic intervention, although further independent validation is required. ©2016 AACR.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon and poorly understood disease. Recent molecular studies have shown important differences from female breast cancer which are likely to influence treatment strategies from the current female-based management towards a more tailored approach. Significantly more MBCs than female breast cancers arise with an underlying germline cancer predisposition, and display a vastly different penetrance compared with females. Furthermore, the genophenotypical association of basal-like cancer with BRCA1 present in female breast cancer is not observed in male breast cancer. Differences in somatic changes between male and female breast cancer have also been reported, with particular enrichment of PIK3CA mutations and a paucity of TP53 mutations. In general, chromosomal-based changes, in particular regions of gains, are seen more frequently in male than female breast cancer and methylation is seen less frequently. Clinically, several molecular subtypes with prognostic relevance have been described, including chromosomal complex high and methylation high groups, and subgroups with profiling signatures pertaining to epithelial mesenchymal transition and hormonal therapy insensitivity. As with female breast cancer, attention to male specific multicentre trials based on the individual characteristics are needed, together with establishment of reliable preclinical models to understand more clearly the pathogenesis of male breast cancer and improve the general poor outcome of this disease. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This review draws on classic and recent retrospective data to synthesize a clearer understanding of the biology and behavior of these rare tumors. Recent Findings: Avoid disfiguring surgery in the pursuit of very wide margins for benign phyllodes tumors unless there are adverse histological features. Encapsulated papillary carcinoma is very good prognosis breast cancer; do not over treat. Metaplastic carcinoma is a basal type breast cancer that may be more responsive to “BRCA1-like” treatments. Complete excision of the capsule is curative for most implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Aromatase inhibitors are still controversial for male breast cancer; tamoxifen is standard. Summary: Available data are useful for guiding the treatment of rare breast cancers, but it must be recognized that there is still a great deal to be learned about each of these entities. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Carcinoma of male breast constitutes 1% of total breast malignancy. Carcinoma arising from ectopic breast tissue in male is an extremely rare entity and can be misdiagnosed. Ectopic breast tissue may be supernumerary or aberrant one. Despite morphologic difference, ectopic breast tissue presents characteristics analogous to orthoptic breast in terms of functional and pathologic degeneration. Most of the ectopic breast tissue occurs in thoracic or abdominal portion of milk line. If found in a location outside the milk line, it proves a diagnostic dilemma. We are reporting a case of 60-year-old male who presented with a fixed mass of size 10cm×8cm, in right chest wall infraclavicular area of 6 months duration. Histopathology of the mass revealed invasive duct carcinoma. He had no evidence of malignant or occult primary lesion in the bilateral mammary glands. Due to the paucity of the literature, incidence of ectopic male breast cancer and its management is not well understood. There is high probability of misdiagnosis of this disease. To the best of our knowledge this is the first described case of ectopic male breast cancer in the chest wall, not along the milk line, which is being reported here for documentation. © 2015, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Methods The goal of this retrospective study is to analyze the epidemiologic, clinic, therapeutic and evolutive profiles of this disease in 140 cases collected at the National Institute of Oncology and military hospital in Rabat, Morocco, between the years 1998 and 2007. Results The mean age was 61 years. A high incidence of overweight was found. The most frequent clinical presentation was a firm subareolar lump in 83 % of cases. The most common pathological type was an infiltrating ductal carcinoma (93 %). Hormone receptors were positive in 86 % of cases. Eighty-five percent of patients underwent simple mastectomy and axillary dissection, 68 % chest wall irradiation after surgery, 54 % received chemotherapy and 82 % hormonal therapy. Median follow-up was 91.1 months. The estimated 5-year and 10-year overall survival was respectively 68 % and 74 %. Conclusion The management of male and female breast carcinoma is the same, as well as their prognosis at equal stages. Future research for better understanding of this disease are needed to improve the management and prognosis of male patients. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS},

Data were obtained by linking the 1996–2007 Florida Cancer Data System, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, and the US Census. Inclusion criteria were males ≥18 years, diagnosed with breast cancer and residing in Florida (n = 1573). To analyze the association between smoking and survival, we performed sequential multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models with progressive adjustment for main confounders. Compared to never smokers, worse survival was found in current (hazard ratio = 1.63; 95 % CI = 1.23–2.16) but not in former smokers (1.26; 0.99–1.59). Those who smoked ≥1 packs/day had worse survival (2.48; 1.59–3.87) than never smokers with a significant dose–response (P for linear trend <0.001). Race-ethnic stratified models comparing current and former smokers with never smokers found significant differences among Whites [(1.88; 1.44–2.44) and (1.31; 1.04–1.65, respectively)] and non-Hispanics, [(1.73; 1.31–2.28) and (1.31; 1.04–1.66, respectively)]. Overall, current smokers were found to have significantly reduced survival, which was worse by intensity of smoking. Also, any smoking history is associated with worse survival in White and non-Hispanic male breast cancer patients compared to never smokers. Thus, male breast cancer patients should be advised to quit smoking. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Substantial controversy exists about the prognostic role of tumor subtypes in male breast cancer (MaBC). The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of each tumor subtype in MaBC and its association with prognosis compared with other factors. We evaluated MaBC patients between 2010 and 2012 with known estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor [together hormone receptor (HR)] status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Patients were classified as: HR-positive/HER2-negative, HR-positive/HER2-positive, HR-negative/HER2-positive, and triple-negative (TN). Univariate and multivariate analyses determined the effect of each variable on overall survival (OS). We included 960 patients. Patient distribution was 84.9 % HR-positive/HER2-negative, 11.6 % HR-positive/HER2-positive, 0.6 % HR-negative/HER2-positive, and 2.9 % TN. TN patients were younger, had higher grade, presented with more advanced stage, were more likely to have mastectomy, and to die of breast cancer (all P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that HER2 positivity was associated with shorter OS (hazard ratio 1.90, P = 0.031) and TN patients had worse prognosis (hazard ratio 5.10, P = 0.0004). In multivariate analysis, older patients (hazard ratio 3.10, P = 0.032), those with stage IV (hazard ratio 16.27, P < 0.001) and those with TN tumors (hazard ratio 4.61, P = 0.002) had significantly worse OS. We observed significant differences in patient characteristics according to tumor subtype. HER2-positive and TN represented a small proportion of cases. In addition to age and stage, tumor subtype has clear influence on OS in MaBC. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

It remains a matter of debate whether invasive lobular carcinoma has better or worse outcome than invasive ductal carcinoma, so that clinicopathological characteristics of tumors are used to evaluate the risk of recurrence. In our case, an unusually small invasive ductal carcinoma with a low level of proliferation had already developed many axillary lymph node metastases in spite of dire clinicopathological characteristics of the invasive lobular carcinoma of the left breast determined during the first treatment, while the invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast was thought to have developed distant metastasis.

	abstract = {Aim of the study: The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the clinicopathological features and treatment results of male breast cancer presented to our tertiary referral center. Material and methods: Between January 1998 and December 2005, a total of 39 men with breast cancer treated at Alexandria Main University Hospital and their medical records were reviewed. Results: The median age of patients was 59 years. Only 3 (7.7%) patients had positive family history. All patients presented by breast swellings that were associated with axillary mass in about one third of them. Around 80% had hormone receptor positive (estrogen and/or progesterone receptors). Two third of patients had advanced T-stage (T3 and T4). Left sided breast cancer occurred in 51.3%. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the most common type of histology encountered and grade 2 was the predominant grade of tumor. Modified radical mastectomy was the most common (87.2%) type of surgery done followed by chemotherapy for 32 patients and loco-regional radiotherapy for 20 patients. Tamoxifen was administered in 31 patients. Distant relapse occurred in 7 patients (17.9%) and local recurrence occurred in 2 patients (5.1%). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 82% and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 84%. Only negative axillary lymph node and positive hormone receptor status were significantly associated with favorable DFS and OS. T-stage, grade of tumor and type of chemotherapy given had no statistically significant impact on either DFS or OS. Conclusions: Male breast cancer is still under-investigated and further researches are warranted.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare disease, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancer cases worldwide. Compared to female breast cancer, the incidence of male breast cancer has risen in recent years, and the relationship between molecular subtype and clinical behavior has rarely been studied. In this study, we examined the molecular subtypes of male breast cancers based on the expression profile of immunomarkers and their association with clinicopathological features. A total of 98 male breast carcinoma patients were investigated retrospectively using immunostaining for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, Ki-67, and P53. Results were interpreted based on the molecular subtype classification of the 13th St Gallen International Expert Consensus (2013). HER2 expression that was 2+ or 3+ was also evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for further validation. The luminal subtype A was the most common in all patients (83.7%, 82/98), followed by the luminal subtype B (16.3%, 16/98). HER-2 subtype and basal-like subtype were not detected. Male breast cancers were classified into luminal subtype A and luminal subtype B, and the HER-2 over-expressing and basal-like subtypes were not found in this study. © 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

	abstract = {Purpose Breast cancer treatment has progressed significantly over the past 20 years. However, knowledge regarding male breast cancer (MBC) is sparse because of its rarity. This study is an investigation of the clinicopathologic features, treatments, and clinical outcomes of MBC. Materials and Methods Clinical records of 59 MBC patients diagnosed during 1995-2014 from seven institutions in Korea were reviewed retrospectively. Results Over a 20-year period, MBC patients accounted for 0.98% among total breast cancer patients, and increased every 5 years. The median age of MBC patients was 66 years (range, 24 to 87 years). Forty-three patients (73%) complained of a palpable breast mass initially. The median symptom duration was 5 months (range, 1 to 36 months). Mastectomy was performed in 96% of the patients. The most frequent histology was infiltrating ductal carcinoma (75%). Ninety-one percent of tumors (38/43) were estrogen receptor-positive, and 28% (11/40) showed epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) overexpression. After curative surgery, 42% of patients (19/45) received adjuvant chemotherapy; 77% (27/35) received hormone therapy. Five out of ten patients with HER-2 overexpressing tumors did not receive adjuvant anti-HER-2 therapy, while two out of four patients with HER-2 overexpressing tumors received palliative trastuzumab for recurrent and metastatic disease. Letrozole was used for one patient in the palliative setting. The median overall survival durations were 7.2 years (range, 0.6 to 17.0 years) in patients with localized disease and 2.9 years (range, 0.6 to 4.3 years) in those with recurrent or metastatic disease. Conclusion Anti-HER-2 and hormonal therapy, except tamoxifen, have been underutilized in Korean MBC patients compared to female breast cancer patients. With the development of precision medicine, active treatment with targeted agents should be applied. Further investigation of the unique pathobiology of MBC is clinically warranted. © 2016 by the Korean Cancer Association.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is known to be rare compared with female breast cancer (FBC) and to account for only 1% of all breast cancers. To date, male patients diagnosed with breast cancer are normally treated based on the guidelines for FBC. Specifically, studies have found that diagnosing and treating MBC patients under the guidelines for the treatment of post-menopausal FBC are more favorable than are those of pre/peri-menopausal FBC from a physiological perspective because MBC and post-menopausal FBC patients show high estrogen receptor (ER) expression in the tumor and low estrogen expression in the body. In this medical study, we aimed to examine whether MBC actually has the same prognosis as post-menopausal FBC. Method: We identified MBC patients who were diagnosed as operable and who completed clinical treatment and we used follow-up data that were collected from January 2001 to January 2011. Each MBC patient was paired with four FBC patients who were diagnosed within the same period (two were pre/peri-menopausal, and two were post-menopausal). We compared disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) among three groups, i.e., pre/peri-menopausal FBC (group A), post-menopausal FBC (group B) and MBC (group M), using the Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox proportional hazards regression model. We also evaluated the clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients using t-tests and chi-square tests. We used ten consecutive years of data that were collected at Zhejiang Provincial Cancer Hospital. Results: We identified 91 MBC cases for group M, 182 FBC cases for group A and 182 FBC cases for group B. The median follow-up period was 112 months. MBC cases were much more frequently ER positive than those of group A and group B (p<0.01); a similar trend was also found for progesterone (PR)-positive cases (p<0.01). The MBC group showed much lower human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) expression than did the other groups (p<0.01). The 10-year OS rates were 79.1% for group M (72/91), 79.1% (144/182) for group A, and 87.9% (160/182) for group B, log-rank test indicated that group M had similar mean OS time as group A and group B (GourpM vs group A: p = 0.709; group M vs group B: p = 0.042). The Cox proportional hazards regression model indicated that pre/peri-menopausal FBC had similar DFS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.706, p = 0.262) and OS (HR = 1.029, p = 0.941) values compared with MBC, whereas post-menopausal FBC had higher DFS (HR = 0.454, p = 0.004) and OS (HR = 0.353, p = 0.003) values than did MBC. Conclusion: Based on this study, we can conclude that MBC displayed higher ER- and PR-positive expression and lower HER2-positive expression than both post-menopausal and pre/perimenopausal FBC. However, the DFS and OS values of MBC were similar to those of pre/peri-menopausal FBC and were worse than were those of post-menopausal FBC. © 2015 Yu et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

	abstract = {A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database study demonstrated improvement in survival after primary tumor surgery in stage IV male breast cancer. Background Primary tumor surgery (PTS) is not a standard treatment modality in stage IV breast cancer. Retrospective studies in female breast cancer show improved survival in women undergoing PTS; however, data regarding the impact of surgery in male breast cancer are lacking. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of PTS on survival among men with metastatic breast cancer. Methods A retrospective study was conducted of men diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1988 to 2011. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to compare the differences in survival in men who did and did not undergo PTS. Results A total of 439 men with stage IV breast cancer at diagnosis were identified, of which 222 (51%) underwent PTS, 171 (77%) mastectomy, and 51 (23%) partial mastectomy. The median age was 65 years; 74% of participants were white, 51% had tumors &#x2264; T2, 65% had estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumor, and 24% had unknown ER status. Univariate analysis between the surgery and no-surgery arms showed that white race (P = .04), lower T stage and grade (P = .0003, P = .004), ER positivity (P = .0002), and later year of diagnosis (P &#x003C; .0001) were associated with better survival. PTS was associated with improvement in median overall survival (29 vs. 11 months, P &#x003C; .0001). On Cox regression analysis, ER negativity (hazard ratio = 2.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.41-3.01; P &#x003C; .0003) and not undergoing PTS were associated with diminished survival (hazard ratio = 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-2.31; P &#x003C; .0001). Conclusion PTS among men with metastatic breast cancer was associated with improved survival in this retrospective analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Solvents contaminated drinking water supplies at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune during 1950s-1985. Methods: We conducted a case-control study among Marines to evaluate associations between residential exposure to contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune and male breast cancer risk. The study included 71 male breast cancer cases and 373 controls identified from the Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) cancer registry whose military personnel records were available. Controls were selected from cancers not known to be associated with solvent exposure and included 270 skin cancers, 71 mesotheliomas, and 32 bone cancers. Base assignment and risk factor information came from military personnel and VA records. Groundwater contaminant fate/transport and distribution system models provided monthly estimated residential contaminant levels. We conducted exact logistic regression using the 50th percentile level among exposed controls to create low and high exposure categories. We calculated 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) to indicate precision of effect estimates. Exploratory analyses used proportional hazards methods to evaluate associations between exposures and age at diagnosis. Results: After adjusting for age at diagnosis, race, and service in Vietnam, the odds ratio (OR) for ever stationed at Camp Lejeune was 1.14 (95 % CI: 0.65, 1.97). Adjusted ORs for high residential cumulative exposures to tetrachloroethylene (PCE), t-1,2 dichloroethylene (DCE), and vinyl chloride were 1.20 [95 % CI: 0.16-5.89], 1.50 [95 % CI: 0.30-6.11], 1.19 [95 % CI: 0.16-5.89], respectively, with a monotonic exposure response relationship for PCE only. However these results were based on two or three cases in the high cumulative exposure categories. Ever stationed at Camp Lejeune and high cumulative exposures to trichloroethylene (TCE), PCE, DCE and vinyl chloride were associated with earlier age at onset for male breast cancer; hazard ratios ranged from 1.4-2.7 with wide confidence intervals for cumulative exposure variables. Conclusion: Findings suggested possible associations between male breast cancer and being stationed at Camp Lejeune and cumulative exposure to PCE, DCE, and vinyl chloride. TCE, PCE, DCE and vinyl chloride cumulative exposures showed possible associations with earlier age at onset of male breast cancer. However, this study was limited by small numbers of cases in high exposure categories. © 2015 Ruckart et al.},

Along with the genomic approach, proteomics are crucial for the improvement of breast cancer diagnosis, sub-classification, for predicting response to different treatment modalities and for predicting prognosis. There are great challenges in identifying discriminatory proteins and the use of specific techniques along with additional analytical tools is required.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Accessory breast tissue is a rare finding in the general population with an incidence of 1-2%. Carcinomas of accessory breast tissue account for ∼0.3% of breast cancers, 5% of which are arising within a supernumerary breast. They are usually diagnosed at a later stage compared with breast cancer, due to their rarity and low clinical suspicion.; CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 58 years old male who was admitted to our hospital for an umbilical hernia, surgical repair. During surgery a small skin biopsy was excised and sent for pathological examination as routine procedure. The histological report revealed the presence of a poorly differentiated carcinoma. Immunochemical analysis confirmed adenocarcinoma of breast origin.; CONCLUSION: Carcinomas of accessory breast tissue are rare and therefore they are usually of advanced stage in time of diagnosis. Few cases have been reported in literature of accessory breast tissue carcinomas in men. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case in the literature, of ectopic breast tissue cancer in the umbilicus.; KEY WORDS: Ectopic breast, Male breast cancer, Umbilicus.; La sede ectopica di tessuto ghiandolare mammario è un’eventualità rara, con un’incidenza del 1-2% nella popolazione generale. I carcinomi insorti in questi tessuto mammari accessori rappresentano circa il 0,3% di tutti i cancri della mammella, 5% dei quali insorti su mammelle soprannumerarie. La loro diagnosi avviene in fase più avanzate che nel caso dei correnti cancri della mammelle in relazione alla loro rarità ed al basso livello di sospetto clinico. Qui è presentato il caso di un uomo di 58 anni ricoverato nel nostro ospedale per la riparazione chirurgica di un’ernia ombelicale. Durante l’intervento venne eseguita una piccola biopsia cutanea per esame istologico quale procedura usuale. Il referto istologico ha rivelato la presenza di un carcinoma scarsamente differenziato, che all’analisi immunoistochimica si è dimostrato essere un adenocarcinoma di origine mammaria. Si conferma la rarità dei carcinomi insorti su tessuto ghiandolare mammario accessorio, che sono per lo più in fase avanzata al momento della diagnosi. Pochi di questi casi sono riportati in letteratura in relazione a tessuto mammario accessorio nel sesso maschile, ed a nostra conoscenza questo è l’unico in letteratura di tessuto mammario carcinomatoso a sede ectopica nell’ombelico.},

	abstract = {Genomic aberrations can be used to subtype breast cancer. In this study, we investigated DNA copy number (CN) profiles of 69 cases of male breast cancer (MBC) by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to detect recurrent gains and losses in comparison with female breast cancers (FBC). Further, we classified these profiles as BRCA1-like, BRCA2-like or non-BRCA-like profiles using previous classifiers derived from FBC, and correlated these profiles with pathological characteristics. We observed large CN gains on chromosome arms 1q, 5p, 8q, 10p, 16p, 17q, and chromosomes 20 and X. Large losses were seen on chromosomes/chromosome arms 1p, 6p, 8p, 9, 11q, 13, 14q, 16q, 17p, and 22. The pattern of gains and losses in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MBC was largely similar to ER+ FBC, except for gains on chromosome X in MBC, which were uncommon in FBC. Out of 69 MBC patients, 15 patients (22%) had a BRCA2-like profile, of which 2 (3%) were also BRCA1-like. One patient (1%) was only BRCA1-like; the remaining 53 (77%) patients were classified as non-BRCA-like. BRCA2-like cases were more often p53 accumulated than non-BRCA-like cases (P=0.014). In conclusion, the pattern of gains and losses in ER+ MBC was largely similar to that of its ER+ FBC counterpart, except for gains on chromosome X in MBC, which are uncommon in FBC. A significant proportion of MBC has a BRCA2-like aCGH profile, pointing to a potentially hereditary nature, and indicating that they could benefit from a drug regimen targeting BRCA defects as in FBC. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare disease, of which little is known. In contrast to female breast cancer, the very vast majority of all cases are positive for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), implicating the function of this steroid hormone receptor in tumor development and progression. Consequently, adjuvant treatment of male breast cancer revolves around inhibition of ERα. In addition, the androgen receptor (AR) gradually receives more attention as a relevant novel target in breast cancer treatment. Importantly, the rationale of treatment decision making is strongly based on parallels with female breast cancer. Yet, prognostic indicators are not necessarily the same in breast cancer between both genders, complicating translatability of knowledge developed in female breast cancer toward male patients. Even though ERα and AR are expressed both in female and male disease, are the genomic functions of both steroid hormone receptors conserved between genders? Recent studies have reported on mutational and epigenetic similarities and differences between male and female breast cancer, further suggesting that some features are strongly conserved between the two diseases, whereas others are not. This review critically discusses the recent developments in the study of male breast cancer in relation to ERα and AR action and highlights the potential future studies to further elucidate the genomic regulation of this rare disease. © 2017 Society for Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) patients seem to have inferior survival compared to female (FBC) ones, which is not fully explained by usual prognostic factors. Recurrence analysis could show differences in relapse patterns and/or in patients' approaches that justify these outcomes. Retrospective analysis of MBC patients treated in a cancer center between 1990 and 2014, looking for relapse. For each patient, three matched FBC patients were selected by: diagnosis' year, age (within 5 years), stage and tumors' type (only luminal-like were considered). Differences between cohorts were assessed by χ2 test and hierarchical clustering was performed to define subgroups according to relapse local. Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan–Meier and compared using log-rank test. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Groups were balanced according to age, histological grade, stage, expression of hormonal receptors and adjuvant treatments. Median time to recurrence was equivalent, p = 0.72, with the majority of patients presented with distant metastases, p = 0.69, with more lung involvement in male, p = 0.003. Male patients were more often proposed to symptomatic treatment (21.1% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.02). Overall and from recurrence survivals were poorer for male, median: 5 years [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.1–5.9 years] and 1 year (95% CI: 0–2.1 years) vs. 10 years (95% CI: 7.8–12.2 years) and 2 years (95% CI: 1.6–2.4 years), p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively, and this tendency remained in the five cluster subgroups, that identified five patterns of relapse, p = 0.003. MBC patients had the worst survival, even after controlling important factors, namely the local of relapse. Palliative systemic treatment had favorable impact in prognosis and its frequently avoidance in male could justify the outcomes differences. © 2016 UICC},

	abstract = {Introduction: Male breast cancer accounts for less than 1% of breast cancers with published overall and disease free survival being lower than in females. Aims: To determine treatment and long term outcomes for male breast cancer patients in our unit. Methods: A database has been maintained for all breast cancer patients diagnosed in our unit since 1993. Patients were identified using the database and information was collated on patient demographics, tumour pathology, treatment and outcomes using the database and retrospective chart review. Patients were followed to cause of death. Results: From 1994-2009 twenty-four cancers were diagnosed in twenty-two patients. Mean age at diagnosis was 69. Male breast cancer patients were treated using similar principles to female breast cancer. Twenty patients underwent mastectomy, two patients underwent wide local excision. No patients developed local recurrence. One patient died from their breast cancer with systemic metastases. 10-year overall survival was 22%, 10 year disease-specific survival was 80%. Other causes of death included medical co-morbidity and secondary cancers. Discussion: Disease free survival in our unit is comparable to other published studies. High age at diagnosis and co-morbidity are the most important factors in determining overall outcome. Treatment pathways for male breast cancer should follow guidelines for female disease in order to optimise outcomes. Future research at national or international level is necessary to ensure the most effective treatments are implemented for male breast cancer patients. © 2017, Ulster Medical Society.

	abstract = {Introduction Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease that accounts for <1% of breast cancer cases. The most common treatment is modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Recently, breast conservative surgery (BCS) is getting popular for MBC treatment. We report a case and reviewed the literature to investigate whether emerging BCS can be considered as an alternative of a more radical surgery. Presentation of case A 46 y.o. patient, presented with a painless left breast lump over a period of six months. The patient underwent a quadrantectomy at another institution. Pathology revealed an intraductal carcinoma in close proximity to the margins of excision. Adjuvant hormonal therapy was proposed to the patient, who refused and was referred to our Institution. We performed a MRM and a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). A contralateral breast liposuction and an adenectomy were also performed. The patient underwent also a nipple-areolar complex reconstruction. The patient didn't receive adjuvant therapy. Discussion Both oncological safety and satisfactory cosmetic outcomes are the goals of MBC treatment. No specific guidelines for MBC treatment have been proposed. MRM is currently the surgical gold standard of MBC (approximately 70% of all cases). Some authors reported that male BCS associated with radiation therapy is a feasible alternative MRM. Taking into account data from the literature and considering the previous surgery, in the case we report, we offered a MRM, SLNB and a contralateral breast symmetrization. Conclusion MRM with SLNB and reconstruction of male breast asymmetry should be still considered as the treatment of choice of MBC. © 2016 The Authors},

Furthermore, in contrast to ER, less is known about the role of the androgen receptor (AR) in male and female BC.

	abstract = {Metastatic breast carcinoma has been described to the various areas in the head and neck region. However, these metastases are rarely found in nasopharynx. Herein we are presenting the first case of male breast carcinoma with the longest survival secondary to distant metastases in right maxillary sinus and extending to the nasopharynx with extensive skeletal & lung metastases. Here we present a case of 65-year-old male with past medical history of right breast carcinoma, presented clinically with symptoms of recurrent sinusitis. Physical examination revealed a mass in the nasopharynx, which subsequently proved to be hormonal receptor positive high-grade adenocarcinoma secondary to metastasis of primary breast cancer on biopsy. The patient received three cycles of palliative chemotherapy based on Doxorubicin with Paclitaxel weekly. In spite of that, he developed pulmonary, liver and bone metastases. Later, treatment regimen was changed to Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel and injectable Zolendronate with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Still he didn't show any improvement and later, he developed febrile neutropenia. Then, he refused further chemotherapy and died after 12 months of receiving the best hospice care. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in terms of incidence and mortality; breast cancer deserves extensive studies and research in different aspects. Breast cancer metastasizing to nasopharynx would be the last diagnosis that comes to mind for a male patient presenting with clinical features suggestive of recurrent sinusitis infection. As recurrent sinusitis is a very common ailment affecting human kind and is mostly due to benign causes. Metastasis, although rare, should be included in the differential diagnosis of nasopharyngeal lesion since it may clinically mimic a benign neoplasm or primary carcinoma. Based on our clinical experience and review of literature, although it is a very rare possibility in a patient with sinusitis, still we advise not to overlook any symptoms suggestive of the etiology of recurrent sinusitis. },

	abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that common genetic variants may contribute to the heritable risk of breast cancer (BC). In this study, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), within the 8q24.21 multi-cancer susceptibility region and within BC-associated loci widespread in the genome, may influence the risk of BC in men, and whether they may be associated with specific clinical-pathologic characteristics of male BC (MBC). In the frame of the ongoing Italian Multicenter Study on MBC, we performed a case-control study on 386 MBC cases, including 50 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, and 1105 healthy male controls, including 197 unaffected BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. All 1491 subjects were genotyped by Sequenom iPLEX technology for a total of 29 susceptibility SNPs. By logistic regression models, we found a significant association with MBC risk for five SNPs: rs1562430 (p = 0.002) and rs445114 (p = 0.026) both within the 8q24.21 region; rs1011970/9p21.3 (p = 0.011), rs614367/11q13.3 (p = 0.016) and rs1314913/14q24.1 (p < 0.0001). Differences in the distribution of rs614367/11q13.3 genotypes according to oestrogen receptor (ER) status (p = 0.006), and of rs1011970/9p21.3 genotypes according to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status (p = 0.002) emerged. Association of rs1011970/9p21.3 risk genotype with HER2+ MBC was confirmed by a multivariate analysis. rs1314913/14q24.1 was associated with increased MBC risk in analyses restricted to male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (p = 0.041). In conclusion, we provided the first evidence that the 8q24.21 region is associated with MBC risk. Furthermore, we showed that the SNPs rs1562430/8q24.21 and rs1314913/14q24.1 strongly influence BC risk in men and suggested that the SNP rs1314913/14q24.1 may act as a risk modifier locus in male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Introduction: Male breast cancer is extremely rare with an incidence of less than 1% of all breast cancers. Literature reports a peak of incidence at roughly 71 years of age. Management currently follows the same clinical pathways as female breast cancer as a general rule. Methods: A retrospective search for all patients who were referred and diagnosed with male breast cancer at our centre was undertaken. Patients notes were then explored for demographics, histological staging, multidisciplinary team meeting outcome and treatment.A literature search including the search terms 'Male Breast Cancer AND Surgery' or 'Male Breast Cancer AND Experience' were used. Non English language articles, or those without abstracts were excluded. Results: Seven patients were reviewed over 3 years (2006-2009). Mean agea was 69 years and mean lesion size was 15 mm. Histology was invasive ductal carcinoma for all patients. All patients were ER receptor positive. Two patients were HER2 positive. Five patients were offered mastectomy. One patient refused treatment. In follow up at 36 months there were 3 recurrences. 1 patient was lost to follow up. There were 3 mortalities.The literature search identified 72 articles. Articles were subdivided into those that discussed the surgical management of male breast cancer (n = 8), articles that discussed male breast cancer as podium presentations or posters with no full text article publication (n = 13) and finally full text publications of case experience of male breast cancer (n = 21). Discussion: We report a series of seven cases of male breast cancer encountered over three years, evaluating patient demographics as well as treatment and outcomes. In our series patients were managed with mastectomy. New evidence is questioning the role of mastectomy against breast conserving surgery in male patients. Furthermore there is a lack of reporting infrastructure for national data capture of the benefits of surgical modalities. Literature review highlights the varied clinical experience between units that remains reported as podium presentation but not published. The establishment of an online international reporting registry would allow for efficient analysis of surgical outcomes to improve patient care from smaller single centres. This would facilitate large scale meta analysis by larger academic surgical centres. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {While rare compared to female breast cancer the incidence of male breast cancer (MBC) has increased in the last few decades. Without comprehensive epidemiological studies, the explanation for the increased incidence of MBC can only be speculated. Nevertheless, one of the most worrying global public health issues is the exponential rise in the number of overweight and obese people, especially in the developed world. Although obesity is not considered an established risk factor for MBC, studies have shown increased incidence among obese individuals. With this observation in mind, this article highlights the correlation between the increased incidence of MBC and the current trends in obesity as a growing problem in the 21st century, including how this may impact treatment. With MBC becoming more prominent we put forward the notion that, not only is obesity a risk factor for MBC, but that increasing obesity trends are a contributing factor to its increased incidence. © 2015 Humphries et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Male breast cancer (MBC) as a second primary cancer (SPC) has a known association with priorMBC. However, its association with non-breast index malignancies, relative to population risk, has not been previously reported. Materials and Methods. Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (9 catchment area) data, we identified MBCs diagnosed from 1973-2012 as their SPC. Information regarding the index malignancy was also obtained. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) ofMBC as SPC were estimated, along with incidence rates and trends. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival. Results. Over a 38-year period, 464 MBCs were identified as SPC. The most common index malignancies were breast (SIR 30.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 21.50-42.92, p< .001), lymphoma (SIR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08-2.22, p5.014), melanoma (SIR 1.26, 95% CI 0.80-1.89), urinary (SIR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74-1.43), colorectal (SIR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69-1.24), and prostate (SIR 0.93 95% CI 0.81-1.07). Apart from the known association with prior breast cancer, the only significant association was with lymphoma as an index cancer, although not significant with a Bonferroni correction. From 1975-2012, incidence of breast cancer as a first cancer increased at an annual percentage change of 1.3% while breast cancer as a SPC increased at 4.7% (both p values < .001). Conclusion.Male breast cancer as a SPC has increasedmarkedly over 4 decades. Men with a history of lymphoma may experience higher-than-expected rates of breast SPC. These observations warrant further research, and suggest possible etiologic connections with disease biology, prior therapy, or genetics. © AlphaMed Press 2017.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease that shares both similarities and differences with female breast cancer (FBC). The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in MBC and compare them with the previously identified transcriptional subgroups of MBC, luminal M1 and M2, as well as the intrinsic subtypes of FBC. Illumina's 450K Infinium arrays were applied to 47 MBC and 188 FBC tumors. Unsupervised clustering of the most variable CpGs among MBC tumors revealed two stable epitypes, designated ME1 and ME2. The methylation patterns differed significantly between the groups and were closely associated with the transcriptional subgroups luminal M1 and M2. Tumors in the ME1 group were more proliferative and aggressive than ME2 tumors, and showed a tendency toward inferior survival. ME1 tumors also displayed hypermethylation of PRC2 target genes and high expression of EZH2, one of the core components of PRC2. Upon combined analysis of MBC and FBC tumors, ME1 MBCs clustered among luminal B FBC tumors and ME2 MBCs clustered within the predominantly luminal A FBC cluster. The majority of the MBC tumors remained grouped together within the clusters rather than being interspersed among the FBC tumors. Differences in the genomic location of methylated CpGs, as well as in the regulation of central canonical pathways may explain the separation between MBC and FBC tumors in the respective clusters. These findings further suggest that MBC is not readily defined using conventional criteria applied to FBC. © 2015 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Prognostic factors in male breast cancer (MaBC) are controversial. The objective of this study was to analyze patient characteristics and prognostic factors in MaBC over the last decade. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, we extracted MaBC patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2012. Patient characteristics were compared between tumor grades. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to determine the effects of each prognostic variable on overall survival (OS). The study included 2992 patients. The majority had ductal (85 %), ER-positive (95.1 %), and PR-positive (86 %) breast cancer; however, only 12.4 % had grade I tumors. Stage I and II disease represented 73 % of cases. There was a significant association between grade III/IV tumors with ductal histology, ER and PR negativity, advanced stage, receipt of mastectomy and radiotherapy, and breast cancer death (all P < 0.05). ER-positive patients had better OS (hazard ratio 0.69, P = 0.03); however, after 7.5 years, OS rates by ER status were similar. In multivariate analysis, older age, grade III/IV tumors, stage IV disease, no surgery, no radiotherapy, ER-negative tumors, and unmarried patients had significantly shorter OS (all P < 0.05). Over the past decade, MaBC has been diagnosed most frequently with early stages of disease and high rates of ER positivity; however, grade I is uncommon. ER positivity is associated with better prognosis, mainly during the first 5 years after diagnosis. Age at diagnosis, tumor grade, stage, surgery, radiotherapy, ER, and marital status have clear impact on OS in MaBC. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon malignancy with an incidence that accounts for about 1% of all breast cancer cases. It commonly presents as a locally advanced tumor that has already spread to the regional nodal basin. Similar to female breast cancers, MBC gene expression profiling and tumor studies help to detect molecular subtypes of tumors that correlate with clinical outcome and mortality rates. Case Report: We report a relatively uncommon case of a 64-year-old male with a BRCA1+ gene mutation that is also found to be HER2+ on receptor analysis. Initial diagnostic studies with mammography and ultrasound revealed a left-sided hypoechoic mass measuring 2.3 cm, located at the 11 o’clock position adjacent to the nipple-areolar complex. Whole body positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan revealed a hypermetabolic retroareolar left breast mass and enlarged, hypermetabolic left axillary lymph nodes. Final pathology revealed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma with a Nottingham histologic score of 3 (mitotic count score, 3; nuclear pleomorphism score, 3). Of the 19 lymph nodes examined, 15 had evidence of macrometastatic disease. Conclusion: This report highlights a novel case of MBC with a rare genotypic presentation. A need exists to further explore this disease process because the literature is scant with information regarding the long-term treatment and outcomes of MBC, especially in the genotypic form presented here. Subsequent studies in the long-term outcomes of various MBC cases will need to be pursued to better understand the optimal screening and treatment strategies for this disease. © Academic Division of Ochsner Clinic Foundation.},

	abstract = {Purpose Because of its rarity, there are no randomized trials investigating postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) in male breast cancer. This study retrospectively examines the impact of PMRT in male breast cancer patients in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Methods and Materials The SEER database 8.3.2 was queried for men ages 20+ with a diagnosis of localized or regional nonmetastatic invasive ductal/lobular carcinoma from 1998 to 2013. Included patients were treated by modified radical mastectomy (MRM), with or without adjuvant external beam radiation. Univariate and multivariate analyses evaluated predictors for PMRT use after MRM. Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) curves of the entire cohort and a case-matched cohort were calculated and compared by the log-rank test. Cox regression was used for multivariate survival analyses. Results A total of 1933 patients were included in the unmatched cohort. There was no difference in 5-year OS between those who received PMRT and those who did not (78% vs 77%, respectively, P=.371); however, in the case-matched analysis, PMRT was associated with improved OS at 5 years (83% vs 54%, P<.001). On subset analysis of the unmatched cohort, PMRT was associated with improved OS in men with 1 to 3 positive nodes (5-year OS 79% vs 72% P=.05) and those with 4+ positive nodes (5-year OS 73% vs 53% P<.001). On multivariate analysis of the unmatched cohort, independent predictors for improved OS were use of PMRT: HR=0.551 (0.412-0.737) and estrogen receptor–positive disease: HR=0.577 (0.339-0.983). Predictors for a survival detriment were higher grade 3/4: HR=1.825 (1.105-3.015), larger tumor T2: HR=1.783 (1.357-2.342), T3/T4: HR=2.683 (1.809-3.978), higher N-stage: N1 HR=1.574 (1.184-2.091), N2/N3: HR=2.328 (1.684-3.218), black race: HR=1.689 (1.222-2.336), and older age 81+: HR=4.164 (1.497-11.582). Conclusions There may be a survival benefit with the addition of PMRT for male breast cancer with node-positive disease. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Several studies have outlined biological differences between female and male breast cancer (MBC) and concluded that MBC should be considered as an entirely separate disease. Whether FOXM1 has any indication for prognosis in MBC patients remains unknown. We sought to examine the expression levels of FOXM1 in MBC and to identify the relationship between FOXM1 expression and patient survival. Patients and Methods: FOXM1 expression was evaluated in a total of 130 MBC specimens. Results: FOXM1 was overexpressed in 37% of the MBC samples. FOXM1 overexpression was significantly associated with tumor size (p = 0.045), histological grade (p = 0.048), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.012), Ki-67 proliferation index (p = 0.016), and molecular subtypes (p < 0.001). Multivariate analyses indicated that FOXM1 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in MBC patients (p < 0.001, hazard ratio = 0.69 (0.43-0.96)). Conclusions: Overexpression of FOXM1 was associated with well-established markers of poor prognosis; thus FOXM1 may represent a potential novel prognostic marker for MBC. © 2017 S.

	abstract = {Introduction: Breast cancer is a malignant neoplasm arising from mammary glands and is a rare entity in the male patient. Spine is a common site for skeletal metastases. Case presentation: A 53-years-old male was admitted to our Neurosurgical unit because of an untreatable dorsal pain. He had been treated 3 years before for breast cancer. A dorsal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evidenced pathological masses at T8 level. A total body Computed Tomography (CT) scan revealed lungs and liver metastases. After a multidisciplinary consult, a posterior T8 decompression, a radiofrequency thermoablation in T8 vertebral body followed by screws and rods fixation (T7-T9) was performed. Post-operative course was uneventful and the patient experienced a significant improvement of dorsal pain. Cycles of adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy followed. After 8 months, patient is still alive and in good general conditions but a spine MRI revealed a rapid and widespread diffusion of ostelytic metastases. Conclusion: Despite the high incidence of breast cancer metastases to the spine, very few clinical reports (just eight, whose only one treated surgically) in the literature deal specifically with metastases from male breast cancer, which is rarer and with a worst prognosis than female counterpart. In spite of the poor course, surgery still plays a role in treating these kind of malignancies and in improving quality of life.},

	abstract = {The frequency of breast cancer in men is extremely rare, reported to be less than 1% and there is currently no available animal model for male mammary tumors. We compared the characteristics of various immunohistochemical markers in N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced mammary adenocarcinomas in male and female Crj:CD(SD)IGS rats including: estrogen receptor α (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), androgen receptor (AR), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Female mammary adenocarcinomas were strongly positive in the nuclei of tumor cells for PCNA and ER (100%) with only 60% and 53% expressing PgR and GATA3, respectively. 100% of male adenocarcinomas also exhibited strongly positive expression in the nuclei of tumor cells for PCNA, with 25% expressing AR and only 8% showing positivity for ER. Male carcinomas did not express PgR or GATA3 and none of the tumors, male or female, were positive for HER2. Based on the observed ER and PgR positivity and HER2 negativity within these tumors, MNU-induced mammary adenocarcinomas in female rats appear to be hormonally dependent, similar to human luminal A type breast cancer. In contrast, MNU-induced mammary adenocarcinomas in male rats showed no reactivity for ER, PgR, HER2 or GATA3, suggesting no hormonal dependency. Both male and female adenocarcinomas showed high proliferating activity by PCNA immunohistochemistry. Based on our literature review, human male breast cancers are mainly dependent on ER and/or PgR, therefore the biological pathogenesis of MNU-induced male mammary cancer in rats may differ from that of male breast cancer in humans. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard procedure in women with breast cancer. The risk of morbidity related to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is similar for men and women with breast cancer and SLNB could minimize this risk. Methods: Between January 2004 and August 2013, 25 men with primary breast cancer were operated on at the Bács-Kiskun County Teaching Hospital. These were reviewed retrospectively. SLNB was performed following lymphoscintigraphy with intraoperative gamma probe detection and blue dye mapping. Results: SLNB was successful in all 16 male patients (100 %), in whom it was attempted. The SLNs were negative in 4 cases (25 %) and were involved in 12. Intraoperative imprint cytology was positive in 9 of the 12 involved cases (75 %) and resulted immediate completion ALND. In 7 patients, the intraoperative imprint cytology was negative, with 3 false-negative results that resulted in delayed completion ALND. After a median follow-up of 48 months, there was only one axillary recurrence after ALND and none in the SLNB group. Conclusions: SLNB is successful and accurate in male breast cancer patients too. Although compared to women a larger proportion of men have positive nodes, for men with negative nodes, ALND-related morbidity may be reduced by SLNB. We recommend SLNB in male patients with breast cancer and clinically negative axilla. © 2014, The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare. We assembled 446 MBCs on tissue microarrays and assessed clinicopathological information, together with data from 15 published studies, totalling 1984 cases. By immunohistochemistry we investigated 14 biomarkers (ERα, ERβ1, ERβ2, ERβ5, PR, AR, Bcl-2, HER2, p53, E-cadherin, Ki67, survivin, prolactin, FOXA1) for survival impact. The main histological subtype in our cohort and combined analyses was ductal (81%, 83%), grade 2; (40%, 44%), respectively. Cases were predominantly ERα (84%, 82%) and PR positive (74%, 71%), respectively, with HER2 expression being infrequent (2%, 10%), respectively. In our cohort, advanced age (>67) was the strongest predictor of overall (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) (p = 0.00001; p = 0.01, respectively). Node positivity negatively impacted DFS (p = 0.04). FOXA1 p = 0.005) and AR p = 0.009) were both positively prognostic for DFS, remaining upon multivariate analysis. Network analysis showed ERα, AR and FOXA1 significantly correlated. In summary, the principle phenotype of MBC was luminal A, ductal, grade 2. In ERα+ MBC, only AR had prognostic significance, suggesting AR blockade could be employed therapeutically. © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes of breast cancer in the male population, 8,607 cases of patients were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, including white males (n = 7122), black males (n = 1111), and other males (American Indian/AK Native, Asian/Pacific Islander) (n = 374). Black male breast cancer patients were more likely to be in stages II-IV and have more advanced tumors. The rate of lymph node (LN) involvement at diagnosis was higher in black men than in whites and others. The ER- and PR-positive rates were lower in black men than in whites and others. The distant metastasis rate was higher in blacks than in whites and others. Furthermore, the overall survival (OR) rates and breast cancer-specific survival rates were significantly poorer in blacks than in whites and others (Χ2 = 29.974, P < 0.001; Χ2 = 7.285, P = 0.026, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, the results showed that race could also be a prognostic indicator (P < 0.001). Moreover, significant differences were also observed in OS among 1:1:1 matched white, black, and other groups (P < 0.001). Differences in outcomes may be partially explained by differences in tumor grades, LN status, and ER and PR status between the 3 groups. This study might provide insights into a better understanding of male breast cancer. © Sun et al.},

	abstract = {The sensitivity of testing BRCA1 and BRCA2 remains unresolved as the frequency of deep intronic splicing variants has not been defined in high-risk familial breast/ovarian cancer families. This variant category is reported at significant frequency in other tumour predisposition genes, including NF1 and MSH2. We carried out comprehensive whole gene RNA analysis on 45 high-risk breast/ovary and male breast cancer families with no identified pathogenic variant on exonic sequencing and copy number analysis of BRCA1/2. In addition, we undertook variant screening of a 10-gene high/moderate risk breast/ovarian cancer panel by next-generation sequencing. DNA testing identified the causative variant in 50/56 (89%) breast/ovarian/male breast cancer families with Manchester scores of ≥50 with two variants being confirmed to affect splicing on RNA analysis. RNA sequencing of BRCA1/BRCA2 on 45 individuals from high-risk families identified no deep intronic variants and did not suggest loss of RNA expression as a cause of lost sensitivity. Panel testing in 42 samples identified a known RAD51D variant, a high-risk ATM variant in another breast ovary family and a truncating CHEK2 mutation. Current exonic sequencing and copy number analysis variant detection methods of BRCA1/2 have high sensitivity in high-risk breast/ovarian cancer families. Sequence analysis of RNA does not identify any variants undetected by current analysis of BRCA1/2. However, RNA analysis clarified the pathogenicity of variants of unknown significance detected by current methods. The low diagnostic uplift achieved through sequence analysis of the other known breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes indicates that further high-risk genes remain to be identified. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Although previous studies have implicated a variety of hormone-related risk factors in the etiology of male breast cancers, no previous studies have examined the effects of endogenous hormones. Patients and Methods: Within the Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project, an international consortium comprising 21 case-control and cohort investigations, a subset of seven prospective cohort studies were able to contribute prediagnostic serum or plasma samples for hormone quantitation. Using a nested case-control design, multivariable unconditional logistic regression analyses estimated odds ratios and 95% CIs for associations between male breast cancer risk and 11 individual estrogens and androgens, as well as selected ratios of these analytes. Results: Data from 101 cases and 217 matched controls were analyzed. After adjustment for age and date of blood draw, race, and body mass index, androgens were found to be largely unrelated to risk, but circulating estradiol levels showed a significant association. Men in the highest quartile had an odds ratio of 2.47 (95% CI, 1.10 to 5.58) compared with those in the lowest quartile (trend P = .06). Assessment of estradiol as a ratio to various individual androgens or sum of androgens showed no further enhancement of risk. These relations were not significantly modified by either age or body mass index, although estradiol was slightly more strongly related to breast cancers occurring among younger (age < 67 years) than older men. Conclusion: Our results support the notion of an important role for estradiol in the etiology of male breast cancers, similar to female breast cancers. © 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer occurs rarely in male patient. BRCA1 gene mutation seems to be related to male breast cancer, but its role is not clearly defined. We have identified in a male patient affected by breast cancer the BRCA1 gene variant p.P142H. We performed a literature research using the keywords “male breast cancer”, “male breast cancer mutations” and “BRCA” and we reviewed the cases. We found ew other studies regarding BRCA1 variant p.P142H, about female subjects. At the moment, BRCA1 gene variant p.P142H is not certainly classified as neutral or deleterious. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 and PALB2 mutation gene has been performed on our patient. Segregation analysis for this p.P142H BRCA1 variant has been extended to the second generation of the family. Genetic tests revealed a clear inheritance regarding the BRCA1 gene p. P142H variant. Of the eight patients with this specific genetic mutation, four presented breast cancer (bilateral in one case), two female and two male. None of the subjects in the family without the BRCA1 gene variant p. P142H presented breast cancer or other BRCA1 gene mutation-related cancers. Our analysis suggests that the BRCA1 gene variant p.P142H mutation is related with male breast cancer. Starting from these data, it can be inferred that more studies on MBC and its relation with the BRCA1 gene mutation P142H variant must be undertaken to improve prognostic and therapeutic strategies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Median age of the cohort was 65 years. Results: Ninety-seven percent were estrogen receptor positive+and 10% human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive. The individual diagnostic marker positivity was 98% for GATA-binding protein 3, 95% for androgen receptor, 90% for progesterone receptor, 88% for deleted in pancreatic cancer 4, 75% for gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, 72% for cytokeratin 7, 55% for mammaglobin, and 15% for vimentin and Wilms tumor protein 1. Caudal type homeobox 2 protein, cytokeratin 20, Napsin A, paired box gene 8, prostate-specific antigen, thyroid transcription factor 1, and uroplakin II were negative in all cases. Survival analyses showed tumor stage, receptor status, and Nottingham prognostic index to be prognostic. The overall survival was 70%, but the breast cancer-specific survival was 92% (mean follow-up, 59 months); 33% developed second malignancy. The immunohistochemistry profile was similar to female breast cancers. Conclusions: The second malignancies in this cohort affected overall survival and suggest the possibility of other germline mutations in addition to BRCA2 in male patients with breast cancer. © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

	abstract = {Purpose: Male Breast Cancer (MBC) remains a poor understood disease. Prognostic factors are not well established and specific prognostic subgroups are warranted. Patients/methods: Retrospectively revision of 111 cases treated in the same Cancer Center. Blinded-central pathological revision with immunohistochemical (IHQ) analysis for estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and androgen (AR) receptors, HER2, ki67 and p53 was done. Cox regression model was used for uni/multivariate survival analysis. Two classifications of Female Breast Cancer (FBC) subgroups (based in ER, PR, HER2, 2000 classification, and in ER, PR, HER2, ki67, 2013 classification) were used to achieve their prognostic value in MBC patients. Hierarchical clustering was performed to define subgroups based on the six-IHQ panel. Results: According to FBC classifications, the majority of tumors were luminal: A (89.2%; 60.0%) and B (7.2%; 35.8%). Triple negative phenotype was infrequent (2.7%; 3.2%) and HER2 enriched, non-luminal, was rare (≤1% in both). In multivariate analysis the poor prognostic factors were: size >2 cm (HR:1.8; 95%CI:1.0-3.4years, p = 0.049), absence of ER (HR:4.9; 95%CI:1.7-14.3years, p = 0.004) and presence of distant metastasis (HR:5.3; 95%CI:2.2-3.1years, p < 0.001). FBC subtypes were independent prognostic factors (p = 0.009, p = 0.046), but when analyzed only luminal groups, prognosis did not differ regardless the classification used (p > 0.20). Clustering defined different subgroups, that have prognostic value in multivariate analysis (p = 0.005), with better survival in ER/PR+, AR-, HER2-and ki67/p53 low group (median: 11.5 years; 95%CI: 6.2-16.8 years) and worst in PR-group (median:4.5 years; 95%CI: 1.6-7.8 years). Conclusion: FBC subtypes do not give the same prognostic information in MBC even in luminal groups. Two subgroups with distinct prognosis were identified in a common six-IHQ panel. Future studies must achieve their real prognostic value in these patients. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: We aim to assess the diagnostic and prognostic values of 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in a small population with male breast cancer (MBC). Materials and Methods: From May 2005 to Jul 2013, we retrospectively reinterpreted 31 FDG PET/CT scans of 25 men (mean age: 67 years; range: 51-81 years) with a proven breast cancer diagnosis, from two Italian centers. In the majority of patients, an invasive ductal cancer was present (68%). PET/CT scan was performed for initial staging in 5 (16%), restaging in 18 (58%), restaging for the increase of tumor markers in 4 (13%), response to therapy in 2 (6%) and during follow-up in 2 cases (6%). The prognostic impact of PET/CT in this male breast cancer population was assessed by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Nuclear medicine imaging was negative in 10 subjects while it resulted positive in the residual 15 patients (60%). At initial staging, in four out of five cases, PET/CT showed a significant uptake in the primary cancer and of those three had also a loco-regional lymphatic and distant metastatic involvement. In restaging setting, PET/CT was more accurate than conventional imaging for detection of distant metastases, resolving two false-positive findings. Finally, a positive PET/CT scan was demonstrated to be prognostically unfavorable as compared to a negative exam. Conclusions: MBC is a rare tumor with similar biological and metabolic characteristics of female breast cancer. FDG PET/CT seems to be useful, particularly in the restaging setting, to delineate the correct therapeutic approach and to predict the prognosis. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Background: BRCA1 and, more commonly, BRCA2 mutations are associated with increased risk of male breast cancer (MBC). However, only a paucity of data exists on the pathology of breast cancers (BCs) in men with BRCA1/2 mutations. Using the largest available dataset, we determined whether MBCs arising in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers display specific pathologic features and whether these features differ from those of BRCA1/2 female BCs (FBCs). Methods: We characterised the pathologic features of 419 BRCA1/2 MBCs and, using logistic regression analysis, contrasted those with data from 9675 BRCA1/2 FBCs and with population-based data from 6351 MBCs in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Results: Among BRCA2 MBCs, grade significantly decreased with increasing age at diagnosis (P = 0.005). Compared with BRCA2 FBCs, BRCA2 MBCs were of significantly higher stage (P for trend = 2 × 10-5) and higher grade (P for trend = 0.005) and were more likely to be oestrogen receptor-positive [odds ratio (OR) 10.59; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 5.15-21.80] and progesterone receptor-positive (OR 5.04; 95 % CI 3.17-8.04). With the exception of grade, similar patterns of associations emerged when we compared BRCA1 MBCs and FBCs. BRCA2 MBCs also presented with higher grade than MBCs from the SEER database (P for trend = 4 × 10-12). Conclusions: On the basis of the largest series analysed to date, our results show that BRCA1/2 MBCs display distinct pathologic characteristics compared with BRCA1/2 FBCs, and we identified a specific BRCA2-associated MBC phenotype characterised by a variable suggesting greater biological aggressiveness (i.e., high histologic grade). These findings could lead to the development of gender-specific risk prediction models and guide clinical strategies appropriate for MBC management. © 2016 Silvestri et al.},

	abstract = {In men, data regarding breast cancer carcinogenesis are limited. The aim of our study was to describe the presence of precursor lesions adjacent to invasive male breast cancer, in order to increase our understanding of carcinogenesis in these patients. Central pathology review was performed for 1328 male breast cancer patients, registered in the retrospective joint analysis of the International Male Breast Cancer Program, which included the presence and type of breast cancer precursor lesions. In a subset, invasive breast cancer was compared with the adjacent precursor lesion by immunohistochemistry (n=83) or targeted next generation sequencing (n=7). Additionally, we correlated the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ with outcome. A substantial proportion (46.2%) of patients with invasive breast cancer also had an adjacent precursor lesion, mainly ductal carcinoma in situ (97.9%). The presence of lobular carcinoma in situ and columnar cell-like lesions were very low (<1%). In the subset of invasive breast cancer cases with adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ (n=83), a complete concordance was observed between the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status of both components. Next generation sequencing on a subset of cases with invasive breast cancer and adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ (n=4) showed identical genomic aberrations, including PIK3CA, GATA3, TP53, and MAP2K4 mutations. Next generation sequencing on a subset of cases with invasive breast cancer and an adjacent columnar cell-like lesion showed genomic concordance in two out of three patients. A multivariate Cox model for survival showed a trend that the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ was associated with a better overall survival, in particular in the Luminal B HER2+ subgroup. In conclusion, ductal carcinoma in situ is the most commonly observed precursor lesion in male breast cancer and its presence seems to be associated with a better outcome, in particular in Luminal B HER2+ cases. The rate of lobular carcinoma in situ and columnar cell-like lesions adjacent to male breast cancer is very low, but our findings support the role of columnar cell-like lesions as a precursor of male breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease that shares some similarities with female breast cancer (FBC). Like FBC, genetic susceptibility to MBC can be referred to mutations in BRCA1 and, particularly, BRCA2 genes. However, only about 10 % of MBCs are caused by BRCA1/2 germ-line mutations, while the largest part are sporadic cancers and may derive from somatic alterations. EMSY, a BRCA2 inactivating gene, emerged as a candidate gene involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic FBC, and its amplification was suggested to be the somatic counterpart of BRCA2 mutations. Considering the relevant role of BRCA2 in MBC, we aimed at investigating the role of EMSY gene copy number variations in male breast tumors. Methods: EMSY copy number variations were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR with TaqMan probes in a selected series of 75 MBCs, characterized for BRCA1/2 mutations. Results: We reported EMSY amplification in 34.7 % of MBCs. A significant association emerged between EMSY amplification and BRCA1/2 mutations (p = 0.03). We identified two amplification subgroups characterized by low and high amplification levels, with BRCA2-related tumors mostly showing low EMSY amplification. Conclusions: Our results show a high frequency of EMSY amplification in MBC, thus pointing to a role of EMSY in the pathogenesis of this disease. EMSY amplification may be a new feature that might uncover underlying molecular pathways of MBCs and may allow for the identification of MBC subgroups with potential clinical implication for targeted therapeutic approaches. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

We retrospectively analyzed the data from 400 Korean patients who were treated for MBC from 1978 to 2009. Patient demographics and clinical information were routinely documented throughout the study period. Survival and prognostic factors were evaluated. Each MBC patient was matched with 5 female breast cancer (FBC) patients based on 7 characteristics and we compared the OS rates between the 2 groups. For MBC cases, the median follow-up was 72 months and the 5-year OS rate was 85.9%. In univariate analyses, the prognostic factors influencing OS were age (more than 60 years, P<0.001), tumor size (>2cm, P=0.007), and having a negative progesterone receptor (PR) status (P =0.042). Only the age (P=0.028) and tumor size (P=0.024) were significant prognostic factors for OS in multivariate analysis. After matching, we had 260 male patients matched to 1300 female patients for analysis. Compared with cases among females, the rate ofmastectomy was higher among MBC cases and tumors, which were almost invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs), were more likely to be located in the central part of the breast. For MBC cases, the percentage of adjuvant radiation therapy was low compared with female cases. The primary hormone therapy agent used was tamoxifen. The 5-year OS rates were similar in MBC compared with FBC (91.0% vs. 92.6%, P=0.300). We found that only the age (more than 60 years) and tumor size were independent prognostic factors of survival in MBC. The prognosis for MBC is similar to that for FBC given similar stage and hormone-receptor status. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and accounts for 1% of all breast cancers. There is limited data on MBC from India. The aim of our study was to assess clinico-pathological parameters and outcome in MBC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis was carried out in 76 patients of MBC who were registered at Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital of All India Institute Of Medical Sciences between 1996 and 2012. Patients' records were retrospective reviewed and data obtained from the computer database using International Classification of Diseases code (C-50). RESULTS: The median age was 59 years (range: 28-80). The median duration of symptoms was 11 months (range: 0.5-40). Breast lump was the most common presenting symptom (left > right side). American Joint Committee on Cancer (7th edition) stage distribution was Stage I-2.6%, Stage II-13.1%, Stage III-59.3% and Stage IV-25%. Modified radical mastectomy was the commonest surgical procedure. Moreover, 30% of tumors were high-grade and 70% had pathological node positive disease. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu positivity was 80% and 28%, respectively. Triple negative breast cancer constituted 19% of cases. With a median follow-up of 36 months, 3 years relapse free survival and overall survival was 60% and 80%. Advanced stage and visceral metastasis at baseline predicted poor outcome. CONCLUSION: MBC constituted 0.8% at our institute. Our study population had a longer time to presentation, advanced disease at presentation, more HER2/neu positivity and triple negativity higher than the available literature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: 5-α reductase inhibitors (5-ARI) have been suggested to increase the risk of male breast cancer. The aim of this study was to study the risk of breast cancer in men on 5-ARI, in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) not on 5-ARI, and in men without BPH. Methods: We performed a population-based cohort study in Sweden with data from The Prescribed Drug Register, The Patient Register, and The Cancer Register. Men on 5-ARI, men on α-blockers, or men who had undergone a transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) prior to or during 2006–2008 were included as exposed to BPH and a specific treatment thereof. For each exposed man, five unexposed men were selected. Risk of breast cancer was calculated in Cox proportional hazard models. Results: There were 124,183 exposed men and 545,293 unexposed men, and during follow-up (median 6 years), 99 men with breast cancer were diagnosed. Compared to unexposed men, men on 5-ARI had a hazard ratio (HR) of breast cancer of 0.74 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.27–2.03), men on α-blockers had HR 1.47 (95 % CI 0.73–2.95), and men with a TUR-P had HR 1.99 (95 % CI 1.05–3.75). Conclusion: No increased risk of breast cancer was observed for men on 5-ARI. However, the increased risk of breast cancer among men who had undergone a TUR-P, a strong indicator of BPH, suggests that the endocrine milieu conducive to BPH is associated with male breast cancer. © 2015, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background The male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare and represents less than 1% of all malignancies in men and only 1% of all breast cancers incident. We illustrate the experience of our team about the clinico-pathological characteristics, treatment and prognostic factors of patients treated over a period of twenty years. Results Forty-seven patients were collected 1995-2014 at the Breast Unit of the Hospital of Terni, Italy. The average age was 67 years and the median time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms was 16 months. The main clinical complaint was sub areolar swelling in 36, 76% of cases. Most patients have come to our attention with advanced disease. The histology of about ninety percent of the tumors were invasive ductal carcinoma. Management consisted mainly of radical mastectomy; followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and hormonal therapy with or without chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 38 months. The evolution has been characterized by local recurrences; in eight cases (17% of all patients). Metastasis occurred in 15 cases (32% of all patients). The site of bone metastases was in eight cases; lung in four cases; liver in three cases; liver and skin in one case and pleura and skin in one case. Conclusion The male breast cancer has many similarities to breast cancer in women, but there are distinct functions that need to be appreciated. Future research for a better understanding of the disease should provide a better account of genetic and epigenetic characteristics of these forms; but, above all, epidemiological and biological cohorts numerically more consistent. © 2016 The Authors.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (mBC) is a rare entity. As detection of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow of females with early stage breast cancer is a promising prognostic marker, we aimed to determine the prevalence and prognostic value of DTCs in mBC. Bone marrow aspirates were collected from male patients undergoing primary surgery for early stage breast cancer (T1–4, N0–2, M0) at Tuebingen University, Germany, between January 2001 and April 2015. DTCs were identified by immunocytochemistry (pancytokeratin antibody A45/B-B3) and cytomorphology. 24 patients with mBC were included into the analysis. DTCs were detected in four of these (17 %). There was no significant association between the DTC status and any other clinicopathological parameter. Also, no significant impact of the DTC status on DFS or OS could be observed. DTCs are detectable in patients with early stage mBC. The detection rate is comparable to that in women. No associations between DTCs and clinicopathological features or prognosis were observed, which is most likely due to the small sample size. The detection of DTCs in male patients with early stage breast cancer emphasizes the transmission of future clinical applications for DTCs from women to men. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Background: Overall, HER2-amplified female breast cancer (FBC) is associated with a high grade, an aggressive phenotype and a poor prognosis. In male breast cancer (MBC) amplification of HER2, located on chromosome 17, occurs at a lower frequency than in FBC, where it is part of complex rearrangements. So far, only few studies have addressed the occurrence of chromosome 17 alterations in small MBC cohorts. Methods: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect and characterize copy number changes on chromosome 17 in a cohort of 139 MBC. The results obtained were compared to those in FBC, and were correlated with clinicopathological features and patient outcome data. Results: We observed a lower frequency of chromosome 17 copy number changes with less complex rearrangement patterns in MBC compared to FBC. Chromosome 17 changes in MBC included gains of 17q and losses of 17p. Whole chromosome 17 polyploidies were not encountered. Two recurrent chromosome 17 amplicons were detected: on 17q12 (encompassing the NEUROD2, HER2, GRB7 and IKZF3 gens) and on 17q23.1 (encompassing the MIR21 and RPS6KB1 genes). Whole arm copy number gains of 17q were associated with decreased 5 year survival rates (p = 0.010). Amplification of HER2 was associated with a high tumor grade, but did not predict patient survival. Although copy number gains of HER2 and NEUROD2 were associated with a high tumor grade, a high mitotic count and a decreased 5 year survival rate (p = 0.015), only tumor size and NEUROD2 copy number gains emerged as independent prognostic factors. Conclusions: In MBC chromosome 17 shows less complex rearrangements and fewer copy number changes compared to FBC. Frequent gains of 17q, encompassing two distinct amplicons, and losses of 17p were observed, but no whole chromosome 17 polyploidies. Only NEUROD2 gains seem to have an independent prognostic impact. These results suggest different roles of chromosome 17 aberrations in male versus female breast carcinogenesis. © 2015, The Author(s).},

A retrospective file review was carried out at two hospitals, one private and one government, of male breast cancer patients from 2007 to 2012 followed by a telephone survey of patients identified during review. Of approximately 3,000 breast cancer patients seen in the 5 years reviewed, 23 cases of male breast cancer were identified. Most were diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (n = 19, 83%). Stage at presentation was from stages 0 to 3 (Stage 0 [n = 2, 9%], Stage 1 [n = 3, 13%], Stage 2 [n = 12, 52%], Stage 3 [n = 6, 26%]) and no patients were metastatic at presentation. The telephonic survey was completed by 18 patients (78%). Nearly all (n = 17/18) shared their diagnosis with family and close friends. Two thirds of patients delayed presentation and government hospital patients were more likely to present later than private sector hospital patients. Although most male breast cancer patients sampled did not perceive the breast cancer diagnosis as affecting their masculinity, Black men and those treated in government hospitals were less likely to be aware of male breast cancer, and were more likely to have their perception of their own masculinity affected. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and its biology is poorly understood. Deregulated Hippo pathway promotes oncogenic functions in female breast cancer. We herein investigated the expression of the Hippo transducers TAZ/YAP and their target CTGF in MBC. Tissue microarrays containing samples from 255 MBC patients were immunostained for TAZ, YAP and CTGF. One hundred and twenty-nine patients were considered eligible. The Pearson's Chi-squared test of independence was used to test the association between categorical variables. The correlation between TAZ, YAP and CTGF was assessed with the Pearson's correlation coefficient. The Kaplan- Meier method and the log-rank test were used for estimating and comparing survival curves. Cox proportional regression models were built to identify variables impacting overall survival. Statistical tests were two-sided. Tumors were considered to harbor active TAZ/YAP-driven gene transcription when they co-expressed TAZ, or YAP, and CTGF. Patients whose tumors had the TAZ/CTGF and YAP/CTGF phenotypes experienced shorter overall survival compared with their negative counterparts (log rank p = 0.036 for both). TAZ/CTGF and YAP/CTGF tumors were associated with decreased survival in patients with invasive ductal carcinomas, G3 tumors, hormone receptor-positive tumors, and tumors with elevated Ki-67. Multivariate analyses confirmed that the TAZ/CTGF and YAP/CTGF phenotypes are independent predictors of survival (HR 2.03, 95% CI: 1.06-3.90, p = 0.033; and HR 2.00, 95% CI: 1.04-3.84, p = 0.037 respectively). Comparable results were obtained when excluding uncommon histotypes (TAZ/CTGF: HR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.16-4.73, p = 0.018. YAP/CTGF: HR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.17-4.77, p = 0.017).

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare malignancy that accounts for less than 1% of all cancers in men and less than 1% of all breast cancers. But the incidence is rising and in some patient groups reaching 15% over the course of their lives. The major risk factors for the development of male breast cancer include advancing age, hormonal imbalance, radiation exposure, and a family history of breast cancer. Regarding the latter, incidence can be linked to mutations in high- or low-penetrance genes. The most relevant risk factor for the development of male breast cancer is a mutation in the BRCA2 gene. Most cases present late because of a lack of awareness of the existence of such a malignancy in males and ignorance of the related risk factors. Additionally, males with breast cancer are at special risk for developing a second cancer. This in depth review highlights the epidemiology and risk factors for the development of male breast cancer. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Recent clinical and imaging studies suggest that sex hormones modulate sexuality according to a psychophysiologic process of lateralization of the brain, with androgens playing a greater role in sexual functioning of left hemibrain/right handedness and estrogens possibly for right hemibrain/left handedness. Based on this perspective, the current study attempted to specify the relationship between hand preference, estrogens, and sexual function in subjects with male breast cancer, taking into account the sexual side effects of tamoxifen as the agent for inhibiting estrogen action. Twenty-eight Romanian men—17 right-handed and 11 left-handed—undergoing treatment with tamoxifen for male breast cancer participated in this study. These men were assessed both prior to and during tamoxifen treatment using the International Index of Erectile Function, a standardized instrument used for the evaluation of various aspects of sexual functioning, including erectile function (EF), orgasmic function (OF), sexual desire (SD), and overall functioning (OF). A main effect for handedness was found on EF, OF, SD, and OS scales, with right-handed men showing higher functioning than left-handed men. Regarding interaction effects, the left-handed group of men showed greater decreased sexual functioning during tamoxifen (on three subscales: OF, SD, OS) compared to right-handed men. Further research should be conducted in order to support and refine this potential lateralized process of sexual neuromodulation within the brain. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Background: Current evidence on risk of prostate cancer following a diagnosis of male breast cancer is limited and guidance for screening in this potentially higher-risk population remainsunclear. Our objective was to quantify prostate cancer risk in men diagnosed with breast cancer. Methods: We identified men diagnosed with first primary breast cancer between 1988 and 2012 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program registry databases. Men were followed for occurrence of a second primary prostate cancer and secondary outcomes of cancer-specific and overall survival. Stratified analyses were performed by age, breast cancer stage, race, and breast cancer hormone receptor status. Excess risk per 10,000 person-years and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. We used multivaraible Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI for characteristics associated with secondary prostate cancer and survival. Results: From a cohort of 5753 men with breast cancer with median follow up of 4.3 years, we identified 250 cases of second primary prostate cancer. Overall, the incidence of second primary prostate cancer was modestly greater than expected (SIR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.93-1.33), although not statistically significant. Stratified analyses demonstrated associations for men ages 65-74 at the time of breast cancer diagnosis (SIR = 1.34, 95%CI 1.01-1.73), hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (SIR = 1.23, 95%CI 1.11-1.39) or AJCC stage I breast cancer (SIR = 1.36, 95%CI 1.04-1.75) and second primary prostate cancer diagnosis. Conclusions: The incidence of prostate cancer in men with history of breast cancer is similar to the general population. Men with favorable characteristics of their breast cancer were more likely to develop prostate cancer, possibly due to a lower competing risk of breast cancer mortality. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease. Due to its rarity, MBC research and clinical approach are mostly based upon data derived from its largely known female counterpart. We aimed at investigating whether MBC cases harbor somatic alterations of genes known as prognostic biomarkers and molecular therapeutic targets in female breast cancer. We examined 103 MBC cases, all characterized for germ-line BRCA1/2 mutations, for somatic alterations in PIK3CA, EGFR, ESR1 and CCND1 genes. Pathogenic mutations of PIK3CA were detected in 2% of MBCs. No pathogenic mutations were identified in ESR1 and EGFR. Gene copy number variations (CNVs) analysis showed amplification of PIK3CA in 8.1%, EGFR in 6.8% and CCND1 in 16% of MBCs, whereas deletion of ESR1 was detected in 15% of MBCs. Somatic mutations and gene amplification were found only in BRCA1/2 mutation negative MBCs. Significant associations emerged between EGFR amplification and large tumor size (T4), ER-negative and HER2-positive status, between CCND1 amplification and HER2-positive and MIB1-positive status, and between ESR1 deletion and ER-negative status. Our results show that amplification of targetable oncogenes is frequent in BRCA1/2 mutation negative MBCs and may identify MBC subsets characterized by aggressive phenotype that may benefit from potential targeted therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Genetic predisposition to male breast cancer (MBC) is not well understood. The aim of this study was to better define the predisposition genes contributing to MBC and the utility of germline multi-gene panel testing (MGPT) for explaining the etiology of MBCs. Methods: Clinical histories and molecular results were retrospectively reviewed for 715 MBC patients who underwent MGPT from March 2012 to June 2016. Results: The detection rate of MGPT was 18.1% for patients tested for variants in 16 breast cancer susceptibility genes and with no prior BRCA1/2 testing. BRCA2 and CHEK2 were the most frequently mutated genes (11.0 and 4.1% of patients with no prior BRCA1/2 testing, respectively). Pathogenic variants in BRCA2 [odds ratio (OR) = 13.9; p = 1.92 × 10−16], CHEK2 (OR = 3.7; p = 6.24 × 10−24), and PALB2 (OR = 6.6, p = 0.01) were associated with significantly increased risks of MBC. The average age at diagnosis of MBC was similar for patients with (64 years) and without (62 years) pathogenic variants. CHEK2 1100delC carriers had a significantly lower average age of diagnosis (n = 7; 54 years) than all others with pathogenic variants (p = 0.03). No significant differences were observed between history of additional primary cancers (non-breast) and family history of male breast cancer for patients with and without pathogenic variants. However, patients with pathogenic variants in BRCA2 were more likely to have a history of multiple primary breast cancers. Conclusion: These data suggest that all MBC patients regardless of age of diagnosis, history of multiple primary cancers, or family history of MBC should be offered MGPT. © 2016, The Author(s).},

We report four Japanese male patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with AIs with or without an LH–RH agonist, and consider the relationship between treatment effect and estradiol (E2) concentration. Three patients were initially treated with AI alone after selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and one received AIs plus an LH–RH agonist after a SERM. Two patients treated with an AI alone responded, one patient with E2 levels below the lower assay limit and the other with levels above the limit. The other treated with an AI alone experienced progression regardless of the E2 levels below the lower assay limit, however, responded after the addition of an LH–RH agonist. E2 concentrations were related to the efficacy of treatment in one patient. The patient initially treated with an AI plus an LH–RH agonist also responded. No grade 3 or 4 adverse events were observed in any of the patients treated with AIs with or without an LH–RH agonist. AIs with or without an LH–RH agonist offer an effective treatment option for hormone receptor-positive metastatic male breast cancer. © 2016, The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Background: Tamoxifen remains the standard hormonotherapy for Male breast cancer patients (MBC). Previous studies, in women, tried to evaluate the impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms in tamoxifen efficacy with conflicting results. Herein we analyze the relation between CYP2D6*4 polymorphism and survival in MBC patients. Patients and methods: Fifty-three patients, proposed to tamoxifen in adjuvant setting, were enrolled. Clinical information was collected from records and histological revision with additional immunochemistry analysis was done to better characterize the tumors. Comprehensive CYP2D6*4 genotyping from blood or tumor tissue was performed and translated into two predicted metabolic activity groups. Results: Patients included in the two CYP2D6*4 groups did not differ concerning to age, histological characteristics, and primary treatments performed. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years-old and patients were submitted at least to mastectomy and adjuvant hormonotherapy. Recurrence was observed in 7 patients (13.2%) and 13 patients (25.5%) died with a 5-year disease-free survival of 86.2%. The poorer metabolizer group had a high risk for recurrence (p = 0.034) and this outcome effect remains in different subgroups: in tumors larger than 2 cm (p < 0.001), nodal status, N0 vs N+ (p = 0.04) and in advanced stage, stage III (p < 0.001). Poorer metabolizer patients had also a worse overall survival when tumors were larger than 2 cm (p = 0.03). Conclusions: In our series, there was an association between CYP2D6*4 polymorphism and a probability of recurrence, with a consistent effect in risk groups defined by classic prognostic factors. Multicentric studies with larger samples are needed to validate these results. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis using clinical and pathologic data from 109 nonmetastatic operable male breast cancer patients treated from January 1996 to December 2011 at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. Log-rank test showed that lower tumor stage, no lymph node involvement, and positive estrogen/progesterone receptor status were good predictors of both disease-free survival and overall survival on univariate analysis. However, hormonotherapy is only a good predictive factor of disease-free survival, and not of overall survival. In addition, based on a Cox proportional hazard regression model, only lymph node involvement, and estrogen/progesterone receptor status were statistically significant predictive factors on multivariate analysis. Our results demonstrated that although adjuvant systemic therapy is used extensively in male breast cancer patients and prognosis has improved over the last few decades, lymph node involvement, and estrogen/progesterone receptor status are still the most important prognostic factors. A prospective multi-center study with a larger sample size is urgently needed to further understand male breast cancer. © 2016 AJA, SIMM & SJTU. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The effect of marital status (MS) on survival varies according to cancer type and gender. There has been no report on the impact of MS on survival in male breast cancer (MBC). This study aims to determine the influence of MS on tumor stage at diagnosis and survival in MBC. Men with MBC ≥18 years of age in the SEER database from 1990 to 2011 were included in the study. MS was classified as married and unmarried (including single, divorced, separated, widowed). Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the 5-year cancer-specific survival. Multivariate regression analyses were done to determine the effect of MS on presence of Stage IV disease at diagnosis and on cancer-specific mortality. The study included 3,761 men; 2,647 (70.4%) were married. Unmarried men were more often diagnosed with Stage IV MBC compared with married (10.7% vs. 5.5%, p <.001). Unmarried men (compared with married) were significantly less likely to undergo surgery (92.4% vs. 96.7%, p <.001). Overall unmarried males with Stages II, III, and IV MBC have significantly worse 5-year cancer-specific survival compared with married. On multivariate analysis, being unmarried was associated with increased hazard of death (HR = 1.43, p <.001) and increased likelihood of Stage IV disease at diagnosis (OR = 1.96, p <.001). Unmarried males with breast cancer are at greater risk for Stage IV disease at diagnosis and poorer outcomes compared with married males. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {It has become customary to extrapolate from the results of treatment trials for female breastcancer and apply them to males with the disease. In the absence of results from national and international randomised trials for male breast cancer (MBC) this appears superficially to be an appropriate response. Closer examination of available data reveals that aspects of the aetiology and treatment of MBC do not fit the simplistic model that men usually have endocrine sensitive tumours which behave like those in postmenopausal women. Most females and males with breast cancer have none of the recognised risk factors, indicating the gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of this disease. Several studies have compared epidemiological risk factors for MBC and female breast cancer (FBC) but many have been blighted by small numbers. In comparison with FBC there is a larger proportion of BRCA2 tumours, (occurring in 10% of MBC), and underrepresentation of BRCA1 tumours (found in only 1%), suggesting significant differences in the genetic aetiology of MBC and FBC. Genome-wide association studies in FBC reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 novel independent loci were consistently associated with disease but for MBC 2 SNPs had a significantly increased risk. Molecular profiles of matched cancers in males and females showed a gender-associated modulation of major processes including energy metabolism, regulation of translation, matrix remodelling and immune recruitment. Immunohistochemistry for kinase inhibitor proteins (KIPs) p27Kip1 and p21Waf1 indicate a significant difference in the immunostaining of tumours from male patients compared with females. MBC is almost always estrogen receptor positive (ER + ve) and so systemic treatment is usually endocrine. With evidence in FBC that aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen in the postmenopausal it was seemingly logical that the same would be true for MBC. Results however suggest less efficacy with AIs and an increase in risk of mortality compared to tamoxifen. The overall survival in male breast cancer was significantly better after adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen compared to an aromatase inhibitor. These important biological differences point the way to the development of new therapies for MBC based on differences rather than similarities with FBC. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) represents a poorly characterised group of tumours, the management of which is largely based on practices established for female breast cancer. However, recent studies demonstrate biological and molecular differences likely to impact on tumour behaviour and therefore patient outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate methylation of a panel of commonly methylated breast cancer genes in familial MBCs. Methods: 60 tumours from 3 BRCA1 and 25 BRCA2 male mutation carriers and 32 males from BRCAX families were assessed for promoter methylation by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting in a panel of 10 genes (RASSF1A, TWIST1, APC, WIF1, MAL, RARβ, CDH1, RUNX3, FOXC1 and GSTP1). An average methylation index (AMI) was calculated for each case comprising the average of the methylation of the 10 genes tested as an indicator of overall tumour promoter region methylation. Promoter hypermethylation and AMI were correlated with BRCA carrier mutation status and clinicopathological parameters including tumour stage, grade, histological subtype and disease specific survival. Results: Tumours arising in BRCA2 mutation carriers showed significantly higher methylation of candidate genes, than those arising in non-BRCA2 familial MBCs (average AMI 23.6 vs 16.6, p = 0.01, 45% of genes hypermethylated vs 34%, p < 0.01). RARβ methylation and AMI-high status were significantly associated with tumour size (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02 respectively), RUNX3 methylation with invasive carcinoma of no special type (94% vs 69%, p = 0.046) and RASSF1A methylation with coexistence of high grade ductal carcinoma in situ (33% vs 6%, p = 0.02). Cluster analysis showed MBCs arising in BRCA2 mutation carriers were characterised by RASSF1A, WIF1, RARβ and GTSP1 methylation (p = 0.02) whereas methylation in BRCAX tumours showed no clear clustering to particular genes. TWIST1 methylation (p = 0.001) and AMI (p = 0.01) were prognostic for disease specific survival. Conclusions: Increased methylation defines a subset of familial MBC and with AMI may be a useful prognostic marker. Methylation might be predictive of response to novel therapeutics that are currently under investigation in other cancer types. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare hormone-driven disease often associated with obesity. HMG-CoAR is the central enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, a molecular route deputed to produce cholesterol and steroid-based hormones. HMG-CoAR regulates the oncogenic Hippo transducers TAZ/YAP whose expression was previously associated with shorter survival in MBC. 225 MBC samples were immunostained for HMG-CoAR and 124 were considered eligible for exploring its relationship with hormone receptors (ER, PgR, AR), Hippo transducers and survival outcomes. HMG-CoAR was positively associated with the expression of hormone receptors (ER, PgR, AR) and Hippo transducers. Overall survival was longer in patients with HMG-CoAR-positive tumors compared with their negative counterparts (p = 0.031). Five- and 10-year survival outcomes were better in patients whose tumors expressed HMG-CoAR (p = 0.044 and p = 0.043). Uni- and multivariate analyses for 10-year survival suggested that HMG-CoAR expression is a protective factor (HR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.25-0.99, p = 0.048 and HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.26-1.07, p = 0.078). Results were confirmed in a sensitivity analysis by excluding uncommon histotypes (multivariate Cox: HR 0.45, 95% CI: 0.21-0.97, p = 0.043). A positive relationship emerged between HMG-CoAR, hormone receptors and TAZ/YAP, suggesting a connection between the mevalonate pathway, the hormonal milieu and Hippo in MBC. Moreover, HMG-CoAR expression may be a favorable prognostic indicator. © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {Aim Several prognostic histological features have been established in female breast cancer (BC), but it is unknown whether these can be extrapolated to male BC patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of several histological features in a large series of male BC. Methods Central pathology review was performed for 1483 male BCs collected through part 1 of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) International Male BC Program. Pathology review included histological subtype, grade, mitotic activity index (MAI), presence of a fibrotic focus and density of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These features were correlated with clinical outcome. The relationship between these features and surrogate molecular subtypes using immunohistochemistry was also assessed. Results Median follow-up for overall survival (OS) was 7.1 years. Overall histological grade was not significantly associated with OS (p = 0.129). MAI, the presence of a fibrotic focus and a low TIL density however were correlated with unfavourable OS (p = 0.023, p = 0.004 and p = 0.011, respectively). BC subtype correlated with TIL density (p = 0.015), as we observed a higher density for human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) positive BC compared to luminal HER2-negative subtype. No association was observed between subtype and fibrotic focus. Conclusions Histologic grade was not significantly correlated with clinical outcome in this series, unlike what is seen in female patients. These results contribute to our understanding of male BC and indicate the importance of further research on the optimisation of risk stratification and treatment decisions for male BC patients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: Breast cancer in men is uncommon; it accounts for 1 % of all patients with primary breast cancer. Its treatment is mostly extrapolated from its female counterpart. Accurate predictions are essential for adjuvant systemic treatment decision-making and informing patients. Several predictive models are available for female breast cancer (FBC) including the Morphometric Prognostic Index (MPI), Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI), Adjuvant! Online and Predict. The aim of this study was to examine and compare the prognostic performance of these models for male breast cancer (MBC). Methods: The population of this study consists of 166 MBC patients. The prognostic scores of the patients are categorized by good, (moderate) and poor, defined by the test itself (MPI and NPI) or based on tertiles (Adjuvant! Online and Predict). Survival according to prognostic score was compared by Kaplan–Meier analysis and differences were tested by logRank. The prognostic performances were evaluated with C-statistics. Calibration was done with the aim to estimate to what extent the survival rates predicted by Predict were similar to the observed survival rates. Results: All prediction models were capable of discriminating between good, moderate and poor survivors. P-values were highly significant. Comparison between the models using C-statistics (n = 88) showed equal performance of MPI (0.67), NPI (0.68), Adjuvant! Online (0.69) and Predict (0.69). Calibration of Predict showed overestimation for MBC patients. Conclusion: In conclusion, MPI, NPI, Adjuvant! and Predict prognostic models, originally developed and validated for FBC patients, also perform quite well for MBC patients. © 2016, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer is a rare event, accounting for approximately 1% of all breast carcinomas. Although men with breast cancer had poorer survival when compared with women, data on prognosis principally derive from retrospective studies and from extrapolation of female breast cancer series. We reported the case of a very long survival patient. Case presentation: A caucasian 42-year-old man underwent radical mastectomy with axillary dissection for breast cancer in 1993. Pathologic stage was pT4pN0M0 infiltrating ductal carcinoma of right breast without lymph nodes metastases. Biological characterization was not available. He received adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy, six cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil, then endocrine therapy with tamoxifen for 5 years and complementary radiotherapy. Then he began clinical-instrumental follow up. In May 1996, a computed tomography scan showed multiple lung metastases. Hereafter he received several oncologic treatment including seven chemotherapy and five endocrine therapy lines with two re-challenge of endocrine therapy. In October 2007 further lung progression was showed and a biopsy was performed to characterize the disease. Histological examination confirmed breast cancer metastases, immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for estrogen receptor, negative for progesterone receptor and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2, proliferative index was 21%. In April 2013, bone disease progression was evident and he received radiant treatment to sacral spine. In May 2014 an off-label treatment with exemestane and everolimus combination was approved by Ethics Committee of the Marche Region. The patient received treatment for 3 months with evident clinical benefit to subcutaneous lesions of the chest wall that were not visible nor palpable on physical examination after 1 month of treatment. Conclusion: That is the case of long survival male breast cancer patient with luminal B subtype and no BRCA mutations. He achieved higher progression free survival with endocrine therapy creating the rationale for last line treatment with everolimus and exemestane combination. Attending conclusive results from ongoing studies, everolimus and exemestane should not be used routinely in male metastatic breast cancer patients, but taking into account for selected cases. At the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of male beast cancer treated with exemestane and everolimus combination. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Male breast cancer is rare, and its genomic landscape has yet to be fully characterized. Lacking studies in men, treatment of males with breast cancer is extrapolated from results in females with breast cancer. We sought to define whether male breast cancers harbor somatic genetic alterations in genes frequently altered in female breast cancers. Experimental Design: All male breast cancers were estrogen receptor-positive, and all but two were HER2-negative. Fifty-nine male breast cancers were subtyped by immunohistochemistry, and tumor-normal pairs were microdissected and subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting all exons of 241 genes frequently mutated in female breast cancers or DNA-repair related. The repertoires of somatic mutations and copy number alterations of male breast cancers were compared with that of subtype-matched female breast cancers. Results: Twenty-nine percent and 71% of male breast cancers were immunohistochemically classified as luminal A-like or luminal B-like, respectively. Male breast cancers displayed a heterogeneous repertoire of somatic genetic alterations that to some extent recapitulated that of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers, including recurrent mutations affecting PIK3CA (20%) and GATA3 (15%). ER-positive/HER2-negative male breast cancers, however, less frequently harbored 16q losses, and PIK3CA and TP53 mutations than ER-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers. In addition, male breast cancers were found to be significantly enriched for mutations affecting DNA repair-related genes. Conclusions: Male breast cancers less frequently harbor somatic genetic alterations typical of ER-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers, such as PIK3CA and TP53 mutations and losses of 16q, suggesting that at least a subset of male breast cancers are driven by a distinct repertoire of somatic changes. Given the genomic differences, caution may be needed in the application of biologic and therapeutic findings from studies of female breast cancers to male breast cancers. © 2016 AACR. © 2016 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare. Given the paucity of randomized trials, treatment is generally extrapolated from female breast cancer guidelines. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of all male patients presenting with MBC at the Department of Oncology at University Federico II of Naples between January 1989 and January 2014. We recorded the following data: baseline characteristics (age, height, weight, body mass index, risk factors, family history), tumor characteristics (side affected, stage, histotype, hormonal and HER2 status, and Ki-67 expression), treatment (type of surgery, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and/or radiotherapy), BRCA1/2 mutation status (if available), other tumors, and long-term survival. Results: Forty-seven patients were analyzed. Median age was 62.0 [55.0-72.0]. Among risk factors, obesity and family history of breast cancer were associated with 21 % and 30 % of MBC cases, respectively. The majority of tumors were diagnosed at an early stage: stage I (34.0 %) and stage II (44.7 %). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the most frequent histologic subtype (95.8 %). Hormone receptors were generally positive (88.4 % of cases were Estrogen receptor [ER] positive and 81.4 % Progesteron receptor [PgR] positive). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was positive in 26.8 % of cases; 7.0 % of MBCs were triple negative. The tumor had high proliferation index (Ki67 ≥ 20 %) in 64.7 %. Surgery was predominantly mastectomy (85.1 %), whereas quadrantectomy was performed in 14.9 % of patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 70.7 % of patients, endocrine therapy to 90.2 %, trastuzumab to 16.7 % and radiotherapy to 32.6 %. BRCA status was available for 17 patients: 10 wild-type, 1 BRCA1 carrier, 5 BRCA2 carriers, 1 unknown variant sequence. The overall estimated long-term survival was about 90 % at 5 years, 80 % at 10 years and 70 % at 20 years. Patients carrying a BRCA mutation had a significantly lower survival than patients with wild-type BRCA (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Long-term survival was high in MBC patients referred to our clinical unit. Survival was poorer in BRCA-mutated patients than in patients with wild-type BRCA. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon malignancy. We have previously reported that the expression of the Hippo transducers TAZ/YAP and their target CTGF was associated with inferior survival in MBC patients. Preclinical evidence demonstrated that Axl is a transcriptional target of TAZ/YAP. Thus, we herein assessed AXL expression to further investigate the significance of active TAZ/YAP-driven transcription in MBC. For this study, 255 MBC samples represented in tissue microarrays were screened for AXL expression, and 116 patients were included. The association between categorical variables was verified by the Pearson's Chi-squared test of independence (2-tailed) or the Fisher Exact test. The relationship between continuous variables was tested with the Pearson's correlation coefficient. The Kaplan–Meier method was used for estimating survival curves, which were compared by log-rank test. Factors potentially impacting 10-year and overall survival were verified in Cox proportional regression models. AXL was positively associated with the TAZ/CTGF and YAP/CTGF phenotypes (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Patients with TAZ/CTGF/AXL- or YAP/CTGF/AXL-expressing tumors had inferior survival compared with non-triple-positive patients (log rank P = 0.042 and P = 0.048, respectively). The variables TAZ/CTGF/AXL and YAP/CTGF/AXL were adverse factors for 10-year survival in the multivariate Cox models (HR 2.31, 95%CI:1.02–5.22, P = 0.045, and HR 2.27, 95%CI:1.00–5.13, P = 0.050). Nearly comparable results were obtained from multivariate analyses of overall survival. The expression pattern of AXL corroborates the idea of the detrimental role of TAZ/YAP activation in MBC. Overall, Hippo-linked biomarkers deserve increased attention in this rare disease. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 2246–2252, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

X chromosome gain has been described as a marker of aggressive behavior in female breast cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the X chromosome in male breast cancer. Twenty cases of male breast invasive ductal carcinoma were retrieved and compared with 10 cases of gynecomastia. Cases were tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization to assess a cytogenetic profile for the X chromosome. The X chromosome status was compared with histopathologic features and stage at presentation. All MBC cases harbored an X chromosome gain (100%) in a variable percentage of neoplastic cells, ranging from 31% to 85% (mean, 59%). On the contrary, all cases of gynecomastia showed wild X chromosome asset. The patients' age at surgery and tumor grading showed a statistically significant correlation (P =.0188-.04), with the percentages of neoplastic cells showing an X chromosome gain. These data suggest that this X chromosome gain plays a role in the neoplastic transformation of male breast epithelial cells. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The role of aromatase inhibitors combined with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog in metastatic male breast cancer patients remains unknown. In this retrospective study we evaluated the activity of letrozole combined with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog as a first- or second-line therapy for metastatic male breast cancer patients. 19 men entered the study. We did not observe any grade 3 or 4 adverse events. 2 patients (10.5 %) had complete response, 7 patients (36.8 %) experienced a partial response, 7 patients (36.8 %) had stable disease lasting ≥6 months, and 3 patients (15.8 %) had progressive disease. Overall, the disease control rate was 84.2 %. Median progression-free survival was 12.5 months (95 % CI 8.2-16.9), median overall survival was 35.8 months (95 % CI 24.4-49.2), 1- and 2-year survival rates were 89.5 and 67 %, respectively. Interestingly, 3 out of 4 patients treated with the combination following disease progression while on aromatase inhibitor monotherapy confirmed or improved the best overall response observed in the first-line setting. The combination of letrozole and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog is effective and safe in hormone-receptor positive, metastatic male breast cancer patients. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Background. Male breast cancer (MBC) is uncommon. As a result, there is limited availability of studies and reviews and even fewer reports from Asia. This is the largest population-based study to compare Chinese MBC patients with female patients during a 10-year period in Hong Kong, Southern China. Methods. A retrospective review of medical records of 132 male and 8,118 female breast cancer patients between year 1997 and 2006 in Hong Kong was performed. Each MBC patient was matched with three female breast cancer patients for further analysis. Different characteristics, overall, breast-cancer specific, and disease-free survivals (DFS) were compared. Results. Mean age at diagnosis of male and female patients was 64.5 and 52.7 years respectively. Male patients showed lower histological grade, overall stage, smaller tumor size, and more positive sensitivity in hormone receptors. They were more likely to die of causes other than breast cancer. Matched analysis found that the 5-year overall survival (OS), breast-cancer-specific mortality, and DFS for male and female patients were 78.7, 90.5, 90.5, and 77.9, 86.4, and 81.4 % respectively. Male patients had poorer OS at early overall stage but better breast-cancer-specific mortality rates at any age (p < 0.01). Male patients had a significant risk of dying due to any cause in the presence of distant relapse and had less risk of dying when tumor was ER-positive and HER2-positive. Conclusions. Chinese male breast cancer patients tend to have poorer OS but better breast-cancer-specific survival compared with their female counterparts. © 2013 Society of Surgical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To analyze the stage-specific management of male breast cancer (MBC) with surgery and radiation therapy (RT) and relate them to outcomes and to female breast cancer (FBC). Methods and Materials: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for all primary invasive MBC and FBC diagnosed from 1973 to 2008. Analyzable data included age, race, registry, grade, stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, type of surgery, and use of RT. Stage was defined as localized (LocD): confined to the breast; regional (RegD): involving skin, chest wall, and/or regional lymph nodes; and distant: M1. The primary endpoint was cause-specific survival (CSS). Results: A total of 4276 cases of MBC and 718,587 cases of FBC were identified. Male breast cancer constituted 0.6% of all breast cancer. Comparing MBC with FBC, mastectomy (M) was used in 87.4% versus 38.3%, and breast-conserving surgery in 12.6% versus 52.6% (P<10-4). For males with LocD, CSS was not significantly different for the 4.6% treated with lumpectomy/RT versus the 70% treated with M alone (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-3.61; P=.57). Postmastectomy RT was delivered in 33% of males with RegD and was not associated with an improvement in CSS (HR 1.11; 95% CI 0.88-1.41; P=.37). There was a significant increase in the use of postmastectomy RT in MBC over time: 24.3%, 27.2%, and 36.8% for 1973-1987, 1988-1997, and 1998-2008, respectively (P<.0001). Cause-specific survival for MBC has improved: the largest significant change was identified for men diagnosed in 1998-2008 compared with 1973-1987 (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.88; P=.0004). Conclusions: Surgical management of MBC is dramatically different than for FBC. The majority of males with LocD receive M despite equivalent CSS with lumpectomy/RT. Postmastectomy RT is greatly underutilized in MBC with RegD, although a CSS benefit was not demonstrated. Outcomes for MBC are improving, attributable to improved therapy and its use in this unscreened population. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {It is well-known that male breast cancer (MBC) susceptibility is mainly due to high-penetrance BRCA1/2 mutations. Here, we investigated whether common low-penetrance breast cancer (BC) susceptibility alleles may influence MBC risk in Italian population and whether variant alleles may be associated with specific clinicopathological features of MBCs. In the frame of the Italian Multicenter Study on MBC, we genotyped 413 MBCs and 745 age-matched male controls at 9 SNPs annotating known BC susceptibility loci. By multivariate logistic regression models, we found a significant increased MBC risk for 3 SNPs, in particular, with codominant models, for rs2046210/ESR1 (OR = 1.71; 95 % CI: 1.43-2.05; p = 0.0001), rs3803662/TOX3 (OR = 1.59; 95 % CI: 1.32-1.92; p = 0.0001), and rs2981582/FGFR2 (OR = 1.26; 95 % CI: 1.05-1.50; p = 0.013). Furthermore, we showed that the prevalence of the risk genotypes of ESR1 tended to be higher in ER- tumors (p = 0.062). In a case-case multivariate analysis, a statistically significant association between ESR1 and ER- tumors was found (OR = 1.88; 95 % CI: 1.03-3.49; p = 0.039). Overall, our data, based on a large and well-characterized MBC series, support the hypothesis that common low-penetrance BC susceptibility alleles play a role in MBC susceptibility and, interestingly, indicate that ESR1 is associated with a distinct tumor subtype defined by ER-negative status. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Gene copy number changes have an important role in carcinogenesis and could serve as potential biomarkers for prognosis and targets for therapy. Copy number changes mapping to chromosome 16 have been reported to be the most frequent alteration observed in female breast cancer and a loss on 16q has been shown to be associated with low grade and better prognosis. In the present study, we aimed to characterize copy number changes on 16q in a group of 135 male breast cancers using a novel multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification kit. One hundred and twelve out of 135 (83%) male breast cancer showed copy number changes of at least one gene on chromosome 16, with frequent loss of 16q (71/135; 53%), either partial (66/135; 49%) or whole arm loss (5/135; 4%). Losses on 16q were thereby less often seen in male breast cancer than previously described in female breast cancer. Loss on 16q was significantly correlated with favorable clinicopathological features such as negative lymph node status, small tumor size, and low grade. Copy number gain of almost all genes on the short arm was also significantly correlated with lymph node negative status. A combination of 16q loss and 16p gain correlated even stronger with negative lymph node status (n=112; P=0.012), which was also underlined by unsupervised clustering. In conclusion, copy number loss on 16q is less frequent in male breast cancer than in female breast cancer, providing further evidence that male breast cancer and female breast cancer are genetically different. Gain on 16p and loss of 16q identify a group of male breast cancer with low propensity to develop lymph node metastases. © 2013 USCAP, Inc.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cancer form in women and it has been extensively studied on the molecular level. Male breast cancer (MBC), on the other hand, is rare and has not been thoroughly investigated in terms of transcriptional profiles or genomic aberrations. Most of our understanding of MBC has therefore been extrapolated from knowledge of female breast cancer. Although differences in addition to similarities with female breast cancer have been reported, the same prognostic and predictive markers are used to determine optimal management strategies for both men and women diagnosed with breast cancer. This review is focused on prognosis for MBC patients, prognostic and predictive factors and molecular subgrouping; comparisons are made with female breast cancer. Information was collected from relevant literature on both male and female breast cancer from the MEDLINE database between 1992 and 2014. MBC is a heterogeneous disease, and on the molecular level many differences compared to female breast cancer have recently been revealed. Two distinct subgroups of MBC, luminal M1 and luminal M2, have been identified which differ from the well-established intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer in women. These novel subgroups of breast cancer therefore appear unique to MBC. Furthermore, several studies report inferior survival for men diagnosed with breast cancer compared to women. New promising prognostic biomarkers for MBC (e.g. NAT1) deserving further attention are reviewed. Further prospective studies aimed at validating the novel subgroups and recently proposed biomarkers for MBC are warranted to provide the basis for optimal patient management in this era of personalized medicine.

	abstract = {Background: The possibility that electromagnetic fields (EMF) exposure may increase male breast cancer risk has been discussed for a long time. However, arguments have been presented that studies limited by poor quality could have led to statistically significant results by chance or bias. Moreover, data fo the last 10 years have not been systematically summarized. Methods and Results: To confirm any possible association, a meta-analysis was performed by a systematic search strategy. Totals of 7 case-control and 11 cohort studies was identified and pooled ORs with 95% CIs were used as the principal outcome measures. Data from these studies were extracted with a standard meta-analysis procedure and grouped in relation to study design, cut-off point, exposure assessment method, adjustment and exposure model. A statistical significant increased risk of male breast cancer with EMF exposure was defined (pooled ORs = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.14 -1.52, P < 0.001), and subgroup analyses also showed similar results. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that EMF exposure may be associated with the increase risk of male breast cancer despite the arguments raised.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a relatively rare disease and because the dedicated literature on MBC is limited, management typically follows guidelines established for female breast cancer (FBC). Although radiation therapy (RT) comprises a critical role in the treatment of MBC, several unique challenges influence its use. Most men with breast cancer present at an older age with more extensive and advanced stage disease than women. In contrast to the predominance of breast conservation therapy in women with breast cancer, the majority of men are treated with mastectomy, with or without post-mastectomy radiation. Although no prospective or randomised trials are available, retrospective data suggests that surgery followed by adjuvant RT significantly improves locoregional control (LRC) in men. This article reviews the utilisation, efficacy and complications associated with adjuvant RT in MBC. © Touch MEdical MEdia 2013.},

	abstract = {Background: The etiology of male breast cancer is poorly understood, partly due to its relative rarity. Although tobacco and alcohol exposures are known carcinogens, their association with male breast cancer risk remains ill-defined. Methods: The Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project consortium provided 2,378 cases and 51,959 controls for analysis from 10 case-control and 10 cohort studies. Individual participant data were harmonized and pooled. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate study design-specific (case-control/cohort) ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI), which were then combined using fixed-effects metaanalysis. Results: Cigarette smoking status, smoking pack-years, duration, intensity, and age at initiation were not associated with male breast cancer risk. Relations with cigar and pipe smoking, tobacco chewing, and snuff use were also null. Recent alcohol consumption and average grams of alcohol consumed per day were also not associated with risk; only one subanalysis of very high recent alcohol consumption (>60 g/day) was tentatively associated with malebreast cancer (ORunexposed referent = 1.29; 95%CI, 0.97-1.71; OR>0-<7g/day referent =1.36; 95% CI, 1.04-1.77). Specificalcoholic beverage types were not associated with male breast cancer. Relations were not altered when stratified by age or body mass index. Conclusions: In this analysis of the Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project, we found little evidence that tobacco and alcohol exposures were associated with risk of male breast cancer. Impact: Tobacco and alcohol do not appear to be carcinogenic for male breast cancer. Future studies should aim to assess these exposures in relation to subtypes of male breast cancer. © 2014 AACR.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer (BC) in males is a rare disease and comprises 0.5-1% of all BC cases. Due to its rarity, there are limited data regarding risk factors, biology and relevant treatment. Aim: A prospective observational study of demographic, clinical and histological characteristics of serially-admitted men with breast cancer was carried out from 1999 to 2009. Patients and Methods: Data were recorded and analyzed from a database including 1,315 cases of BC. Registered data concerned age, initial presentation, family and lifestyle history (risk factors), histological features, phenotypic subtypes and TNM staging. Results: Twenty two men with BC were identified, with a median age of 63 years. The most common initial presentation was a palpable lump in 12 patients, nipple contraction in three and ulceration in three. According to their medical history, nine men were overweight, 10 suffered from hypertension and 12 were smokers. The most prevalent phenotype was luminal-A followed by triple-negative type. BC in none of the cases was HER 2-amplified. The majority of cases were grade II or III and stage II or III. Conclusion: In the present small study, we confirm that BC in males is rare. It is a disease of middle-age and presents at advanced stages. Most of patients had 1-3 risk factors for BC. Expression of hormonal receptors occurs in the majority of BC tumors in males and with rarity in HER 2 amplification.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer is a rare neoplasm, and its treatments are based on those of female breast cancer. This study aimed to analyze 20 years of male breast cancer clinical characteristics and treatment results from the Middle Black Sea Region of Turkey. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 16 male breast cancer patients treated in our tertiary hospital between 1994 and 2014 was performed. Epidemiologic data, tumor characteristics, and treatments were recorded and compared with 466 female breast cancer ((premenopausal; n = 230) + (postmenopausal n = 236)) patients. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates were calculated. Results: Male breast cancer constituted 0.1% of all malignant neoplasms in both sexes, 0.2% of all malignant neoplasms in males, and 0.7% of all breast cancers. The mean patient age in this study was 59.8 ± 9.5 (39-74) years. The mean time between first symptom and diagnosis was 32.4 ± 5.3 (3-60) months. Histology revealed infiltrative ductal carcinoma in 81.3% of patients. The most common detected molecular subtype was luminal A, in 12 (75%) patients. Estrogen receptor rate (93.8%) in male breast cancer patients was significantly higher than that in female breast cancer (70.8% in all females, p = 0.003; 68.2% in postmenopausal females, p = 0.002) patients. Most of the tumors (56.3%) were grade 2. Tumor stage was T4 in 50% of males. The majority (56.3%) of the patients were stage III at diagnosis. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and endocrine-therapy were applied to 62.5%, 62.5%, 81.2% and 73.3%, respectively. Loco-regional failure did not occur in any of the cases. All recurrences were metastastic. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates in male breast cancer patients were 58% and 68%, respectively. Conclusions: Tumors found in male breast cancer patients were similar in size to tumors found in females, but they advanced to T4 stage more rapidly because of the lack of breast parenchymal tissues. The rate of estrogen receptor expression tended to be higher in male breast cancer patients than in female breast cancer patients. Metastasis is the most important problem in initially non-metastatic male breast cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer accounts for less than 1% of all cancers found in men. It usually presents at a later age and stage as compared to female breast cancer. Treatment strategies are extrapolated from the management of female breast cancer. Our study here looked at 18 patients diagnosed with and treated for male breast cancer at The Aga Khan University Hospital in Pakistan. We compared our findings with the existing data from Asian and Western countries. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted looking at patients with male breast cancer between January 1986 and December 2009. Patient and disease characteristics were analyzed and 5 year overall survival was calculated using Microsoft Excel and SPSS. Results: The average age at diagnosis was 52 years (38-67 years). Twelve (66.7%) patients had axillary lymphadenopathy. Stage II disease was the most common stage at presentation (9 patients, 50%). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was seen in 16 patients (88.8%). Seven lesions were positive for both estrogen and progesterone receptors. Sixteen patients had surgery in the form of either modified radical mastectomy or radical mastectomy. Radiation was used in 7 patients in an adjuvant setting. The five year overall survival for stage I, II, III and IV disease was 100% vs 78% vs 50% vs 0%( p < 0.05). Five year overall survival was 61%. None of the other prognostic factors were statistically significant. Median follow up was 15 months (3-202 months). Conclusions: Male breast cancer may be on a slow rise but is still an uncommon disease. Tumor stage and lymph node status are important prognostic markers. Public awareness and screening may help in detecting the disease at an earlier stage. Prospective trials are needed to improve the management of this disease.},

	abstract = {Background:Male breast cancer (MBC) is still poorly understood with a large proportion arising in families with a history of breast cancer. Genomic studies have focused on germline determinants of MBC risk, with minimal knowledge of somatic changes in these cancers.Methods:Using a TruSeq amplicon cancer panel, this study evaluated 48 familial MBCs (3 BRCA1 germline mutant, 17 BRCA2 germline mutant and 28 BRCAX) for hotspot somatic mutations and copy number changes in 48 common cancer genes.Results:Twelve missense mutations included nine PIK3CA mutations (seven in BRCAX patients), two TP53 mutations (both in BRCA2 patients) and one PTEN mutation. Common gains were seen in GNAS (34.1%) and losses were seen in GNAQ (36.4%), ABL1 (47.7%) and ATM (34.1%). Gains of HRAS (37.5% vs 3%, P=0.006), STK11 (25.0% vs 0%, P=0.01) and SMARCB1 (18.8% vs 0%, P=0.04) and the loss of RB1 (43.8% vs 13%, P=0.03) were specific to BRCA2 tumours.Conclusions:This study is the first to perform high-throughput somatic sequencing on familial MBCs. Overall, PIK3CA mutations are most commonly seen, with fewer TP53 and PTEN mutations, similar to the profile seen in luminal A female breast cancers. Differences in mutation profiles and patterns of gene gains/losses are seen between BRCA2 (associated with TP53/PTEN mutations, loss of RB1 and gain of HRAS, STK11 and SMARCB1) and BRCAX (associated with PIK3CA mutations) tumours, suggesting that BRCA2 and BRCAX MBCs may be distinct and arise from different tumour pathways. This has implications on potential therapies, depending on the BRCA status of MBC patients. © 2014 Cancer Research UK.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare. Molecular subtype has been utilized widely in female breast cancer. But the relationship between subtype and prognosis in MBC patients is still unknown. We aim to study the impact of molecular subtype on the prognosis of MBC. Methods: We identified MBC cases from 1990 to 2011 retrospectively; molecular subtype was assigned by immunohistochemistry. We compared overall survival in different subtypes by Kaplan-Meier method and COX proportional hazard regression model. Results: 68 patients with MBC were included in analysis with 115months of a median follow-up time. Comparing to non-luminal A (subtypes of Luminal B, HER2 over-express and Basal-like) group, patients with luminal A had a lower recurrent rate and better overall survival (10-year survival rate was 78.0% vs 67.0%, mean survival time 197.46±12.22months vs 146.51±16.88months, p<0.05).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer occurs rarely in men. To the authors' knowledge, no population-based estimates of the incidence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer or of the distribution of breast cancer subtypes among male breast cancer patients have been published to date. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to explore breast tumor subtype distribution by race/ethnicity among men in the large, ethnically diverse population of California. METHODS: This study included men who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2005 and 2009 with known estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) (together, hormone receptor [HR]) status and HER2 status reported to the California Cancer Registry. Among the men with HR-positive tumors, survival probabilities between groups were compared using log-rank tests. RESULTS: Six hundred six patients were included. The median age at diagnosis was 68 years. Four hundred ninety-four men (81.5%) had HR-positive tumors (defined as ER-positive and/or PR-positive and HER2-negative). Ninety men (14.9%) had HER2-positive tumors, and 22 (3.6%) had triple receptor-negative (TN) tumors. Among the patients with HR-positive tumors, non-Hispanic black men and Hispanic men were more likely to have PR-negative tumors than non-Hispanic white men. No statistically significant differences in survival were observed according to tumor subtype (P =.08). Differences in survival according to race/ethnicity were observed among all patients (P =.087) and among those with HR-positive tumors (P =.0170), and non-Hispanic black men had poorer outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, representative cohort of men with breast cancer, the distribution of tumor subtypes was different from that reported for women and varied by patient race/ethnicity. Non-Hispanic black men were more likely to have TN tumors and ER-positive/PR-negative tumors than white men. Copyright © 2013 American Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate tumor characteristics, management and survival in elderly male breast cancer patients in comparison with younger men. Methods: We reviewed medical records of 99 male breast cancer patients between 1972 and 2011. The median age of the patients was 64.5 years. Patient characteristics including clinicopathologic factors, treatment modalities, survival and prognostic factors were evaluated. Patients were subdivided into two groups according to their age (young, <65 years; old, ≥65 years) and compared based on these factors. Results: Elderly male breast cancer patients had larger tumors in more advanced stages at the time of diagnosis compared with younger patients. In spite of the larger tumors at presentation, older patients had tumors with more favorable biological characteristics, such as higher ratio of estrogen and progesterone receptor expression. Ten-year cancer-specific survival for older patients was 49.2% compared with 55.8% in younger men (P = 0.8). Prognostic factors influencing overall survival in univariate analysis were: the presence of metastatic axillary lymph nodes (P = 0.0001), T stage (P = 0.001) and age ≥65 years. Multivariate analysis indicated T stage (P = 0.008) and N stage (P = 0.038) as the significant negative prognostic factors for overall survival. Although surgery, radiotherapy and hormone therapy were equally utilized in old and young patients, old patients were less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the differences in the clinical and biological characteristics of male breast cancer according to the age of the patients. © The Author 2012.

	abstract = {Methods: A case–control study was conducted with data from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink database among all men aged 45 years and older in the period 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2011. Cases of men diagnosed with breast cancer were matched to up 10 controls on age and general practice. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were estimated for the risk of breast cancer associated with the use of 5-ARIs.; Results: Three hundred and ninety-eight cases were identified and matched to 3,930 controls. Ever use of 5-ARIs was associated with an adjusted odds ratio for breast cancer of 1.08 (95 % CI 0.62–1.87) compared to non-users. Increasing cumulative duration of treatment showed no increasing risks: adjusted odds ratios for use for less than 280, for 280 to 1,036 and for more than 1,036 days were 1.21 (95 % CI 0.47–3.10), 0.94 (95 % CI 0.36–2.41) and 1.29 (95 % CI 0.54–3.08), respectively.; Conclusions: In this study, there was no evidence of an association between short- or long-term treatment with 5-ARIs and the risk for breast cancer in older men.; Background: The 5α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARI) finasteride and dutasteride are indicated for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. Case reports have suggested that 5-ARIs increase the risk for male breast cancer, with no conclusive evidence. The objective of this study was to quantify the association between use of 5-ARIs and the risk for male breast cancer. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background /Aim: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease. To characterize male breast cancer in Tanta University Hospital, we systematically analyze available data on male breast cancer in our department. Methods: Twenty nine patients with non-metastatic MBC and a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of ≥70, and adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic functions; were enrolled. All patients were symptomatic and diagnosed by preoperative fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) or biopsy. They were treated between January 2000 and January 2010 at Clinical Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University Hospital, Egypt and Surgery Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University Hospital, Egypt. No Prior therapy was permitted. Characteristics of the patients, and tumors were analyzed. Results: The study included 29 males non-metastatic invasive breast carcinomas with their age ranging from 28 to 80 years at the time of diagnosis (mean 52.8 years). Their tumors ranged in size from 1.5 cm to 8 cm. The majority of cases were T3, node positive and grade II or greater. They showed ER positivity in 19 cases (65.5%) and HER-2 positivity in 6 cases (20.7%). Median follow-up was 53 (6- 120) months. The 5 and 10 year overall survival rates were 70.6%, and 57.0% respectively. Conclusion: The tumor biology of MBC is not significantly different from that of females, however, limited public awareness and absence of adequate screening for MBC result in delayed diagnosis and poor outcomes. Therefore, education, an appropriate system for early detection, and adequate treatment are prerequisite for improving outcomes, and men presenting any breast symptoms should be examined in the same manner and degree of urgency as in women to detect cancer at an early stage and better treatment outcomes.},

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of MBC patients who were diagnosed in our hospital between March 2002 and March 2012. Results: The median age of diagnosis of MBC was 62 years, which was 9 years older than female breast cancer (FBC) patients. The highest proportion of MBC patients was in the 50-59-year age group. The percentage of invasive ductal carcinoma in MBC was much higher than in FBC (P = 0.000). The positive rate of estrogen receptors in MBC patients (87.9 %) was significantly higher than in FBC patients (P = 0.048), whereas HER-2 was positive in 17.2 % of MBC patients, which was significantly lower than in FBC patients (P = 0.001). There was a consistent significant difference in luminal subtypes of FBC and MBC patients (P = 0.000). The overall survival rates of MBC were significantly higher than FBC (P = 0.004). HER-2-positive patients had a statistically worse prognosis than HER-2-negative patients (P = 0.040). Lymph node metastasis and larger tumor size were also associated with poorer prognosis (P = 0.056 and P = 0.088). The level of hormones was examined in 7 patients, and abnormal hormone levels were detected in 4. Conclusion: The FBC patients were significantly different from the MBC in clinicopathologic and prognostic characteristics. HER-2 positivity was an important factor for prognosis. © 2013 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Although a substantial proportion of male breast cancers (MBCs) are hereditary, the molecular pathways that are activated are unknown. We therefore examined the frequency and clinicopathological associations of the PIK3CA/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and their regulatory genes in familial MBC. Methods: High resolution melting analysis and confirmatory sequencing was used to determine the presence of somatic mutations in PIK3CA (exon 9 and 20), AKT1 (exon 4), KRAS (exon 2) and BRAF (exon 15) genes in 57 familial MBCs. Further analysis of the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway was performed using immunohistochemistry for the pAKT1, pS6 and p4EBP1 biomarkers. Results: PIK3CA somatic mutations were identified in 10.5% (6 of 57) of cases; there were no AKT1, KRAS or BRAF somatic mutations. PIK3CA mutations were significantly more frequent in cancers from BRCAX patients (17.2%, 5/29) than BRCA2 (0%, 0/25) carriers (P = 0.030). Two BRCAX patients had an E547K mutation which has only been reported in one female breast cancer previously. PIK3CA mutation was significantly correlated with positive pS6 (83.3% vs. 32.0%, P = 0.024) and negative p4EBP1 (100% vs. 38.0%, P = 0.006) expression, but not pAKT expression. Expression of nuclear p4EBP1 correlated with BRCA2 mutation carrier status (68.0% vs. 38.7%, P = 0.035). Conclusions: Somatic PIK3CA mutation is present in familial male breast cancer but absent in BRCA2 carriers. The presence of two of the extremely rare E547K PIK3CA mutations in our cohort may have specific relevance in MBCs. Further study of PIK3CA in MBCs, and in particular BRCAX patients, may contribute to further establishing the relevance of specific PIK3CA mutations in MBC aetiology and in the identification of particular patient groups most likely to benefit from therapeutic targeting with the novel PIK3CA inhibitors that are currently in development. © 2013 Deb et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Results: The mean age of the subjects was 61 years (range: 50-73). The most clinical presentation was a palpable breast mass. The mean diameter of the lesions was 2.58 cm (range: 2.0-3.5 cm). All patients underwent modified radical mastectomy. The postoperative histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma consistent with the results of preoperative core biopsies. Preoperative imaging studies and postoperative pathological analyses indicated axillary lymph node positivity. Postoperative adjuvant therapies were performed. Conclusion: The prognosis of breast cancer is similar in male and female patients when detected in similar stages. Although breast cancer is very rare in men, it is detected in advanced stage because of late diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have shown the prognostic significance of nuclear morphometry in breast cancer patients. Wide acceptance of morphometric methods has, however, been hampered by the tedious and time consuming nature of the manual segmentation of nuclei and the lack of equipment for high throughput digitization of slides. Recently, whole slide imaging became more affordable and widely available, making fully digital pathology archives feasible. In this study, we employ an automatic nuclei segmentation algorithm to extract nuclear morphometry features related to size and we analyze their prognostic value in male breast cancer. The study population comprised 101 male breast cancer patients for whom survival data was available (median follow-up of 5.7 years). Automatic segmentation was performed on digitized tissue microarray slides, and for each patient, the mean nuclear area and the standard deviation of the nuclear area were calculated. In univariate survival analysis, a significant difference was found between patients with low and high mean nuclear area (P0.022), while nuclear atypia score did not provide prognostic value. In Cox regression, mean nuclear area had independent additional prognostic value (P0.032) to tumor size and tubule formation. In conclusion, we present an automatic method for nuclear morphometry and its application in male breast cancer prognosis. The automatically extracted mean nuclear area proved to be a significant prognostic indicator. With the increasing availability of slide scanning equipment in pathology labs, these kinds of quantitative approaches can be easily integrated in the workflow of routine pathology practice. © 2012 USCAP, Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To describe the clinical-epidemiological features of male patients with breast cancer in Brazil. Methods: Data from male patients with breast cancer treated from 2000 through 2009 were obtained from the Brazilian Hospital Cancer Register databases. Descriptive statistics were performed. Results: A total of 1189 male patients were included. The mean age at diagnosis was 59.6 years (±13.6). Tumours were categorised as clinical stage I (14.3%), stage II (38.3%), stage III (34.1%) and stage IV (13.3%). The most frequent histological type was invasive ductal carcinoma (83.7%). The first course treatment (alone or combined) consisted of chemotherapy in 53.2%, surgery in 49.2, radiation therapy in 36.8 and hormonal therapy in 21.0%; 3.4% of cases did not receive treatment. Treatment modality varies according to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. The inadequate response rate was 15.9%, and 7.4% of patients died after the first course of treatment. Adequate response according to the first-course cancer treatment, after adjusted for clinical stage, was associated with being Caucasian (odds ratio (OR)=2.50; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.35-4.65) and submitted to chemotherapy (OR=0.46; 95% CI: 0.28-0.74). Conclusions: Male breast cancer diagnosis is often made in the advanced stage. Consequently, patients were subjected to more aggressive treatments, with poorer clinical response. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Metastasized male breast cancer (MMBC) is a rare disease. Given its low incidence, data regarding tumor biology, current treatment options, and survival rates are scarce. Patients and Methods: A chart review was performed of MMBC patients consecutively registered in regional cancer registries in Germany between 1995 and 2011. Tumor characteristics, treatment, and survival rates were documented and statistically evaluated. Results: 41 men with MMBC represented 25.6% of a total of 160 patients with MBC. 16 (39%) patients showed primary metastases, and 25 (61%) had recurrent metastases. Median survival from occurrence of metastasis was 32 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 68 months. 68.3% (n = 28) of the cohort received systemic therapy favoring endocrine therapy (n = 25, 61.9%). Prolonged metastatic OS (p = 0.02) was observed in patients having had a systemic treatment. Metastatic patients having received endocrine treatment showed significantly prolonged survival rates. Furthermore, patients receiving palliative chemotherapy had a significant survival benefit compared to those in whom chemotherapy was omitted. Conclusion: Our results suggest that systemic treatment in the form of both palliative chemotherapy and endocrine therapy improves outcome of MMBC. Therefore, it seems reasonable that treatment of MMBC should be based on the guidelines for female breast cancer. © 2014 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg.},

	abstract = {Background: Although mastectomy is considered the gold standard for male breast cancer (MBC), the utilization of lumpectomy and its impact on outcomes in MBC patients has not been previously studied. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify all MBC patients who underwent either mastectomy or less than mastectomy (i.e., lumpectomy) between 1983 and 2009. Results: A total of 4707 (86.8 %) men underwent mastectomy and 718 (13.2 %) underwent lumpectomy. A greater proportion of patients underwent lumpectomy later in the study period (1983 to 1986, 10.6 %, vs. 2007 to 2009, 15.1 %). A greater percentage of lumpectomy patients were 80 years or older (21.3 % vs. 16.3 %), had stage IV disease (7.3 % vs. 3.1 %), and received no lymph node sampling (34.3 % vs. 6.9 %). Only 35.4 % of patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy. Ten-year breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival were 82.8 % and 46.9 %, respectively, in lumpectomy patients vs. 77.3 % and 46.4 %, respectively, in mastectomy patients. On Cox proportional hazards regression, lumpectomy was not independently associated with worse breast cancer-specific survival (odds ratio 1.09, 95 % confidence interval 0.87-1.37) or overall survival (odds ratio 1.12, 95 % confidence interval 0.98-1.27) after controlling for age, race, stage, and grade, as well as whether radiotherapy was received. Conclusions: Lumpectomy is performed in a small but growing proportion of MBC patients. These patients are not only older and more likely to have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, but they also are less likely to receive standard of care therapy, such as lymph node sampling and adjuvant radiotherapy. Despite these observations, breast cancer-specific survival is unaffected by the type of surgery. © 2013 Society of Surgical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Back ground. Due to its rarity, male breast cancer (mBC) remains an inadequately characterized disease, and current evidence for treatment derives from female breast cancer (FBC). Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the clinic opathological characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes of mBCs treated from 2000 to 2013. Results. From a total of 97 patients with mBC, 6 (6.2%) with ductal in situ carcinoma were excluded, and 91 patients with invasive carcinoma were analyzed. Median age was 65 years (range: 25-87 years). Estrogen receptors were positive in 88 patients (96.7%), and progesterone receptors were positive in 84 patients (92.3%). HER-2 was over expressed in 13 of 85 patients (16%). Median follow-up was 51.5 months (range: 0.5-219.3 months). Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 50%, whereas overall survival (OS) was 68.1%. Patients with grades 1 and 2 presented 5-year PFS of 71% versus 22.5% for patients with grade 3 disease; 5-year OS was 85.7% for patients with grades 1 and 2 versus 53.3% of patients with grade 3. Ki-67 score >20% and adjuvant chemotherapy were also statistically significant for OS on univariate analyses. Twenty-six of 87 patients (29.8%) experienced recurrent disease and 16 of 91 patients (17.6%) developed a second neoplasia. Conclusion. Male breast cancer shows different biological patterns compared with FBC, with higher positive hormone-receptor status and lower HER-2 over expression. Grade 3 and Ki-67 >20% were associated with shorter OS. © AlphaMed Press 2015.},

The left breast showed a hard lump measuring 4x5cm in the nipple-areolar area, unattached to skin, or underlying structure. There was no palpable axillary lymph node bilaterally. A wedge biopsy of right breast ulcer and excision of the left breast lump confirmed bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma - Grade 2 tumor in both breasts. He had bilateral simple mastectomy and chemotherapy; defaulted for 18 months during treatment, and re-presented with bilateral tumor recurrence.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease. To date, therapy is mainly based on studies and clinical experiences with breast cancer in women. Only little is known about molecular typing of MBC, particularly with regard to potential biological predictors for adjuvant therapy. In female breast cancer tumors with chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) duplication, HER2 and/or Topoisomerase II alpha (Topo II-α) gene alterations have been suggested to be associated with poor prognosis and increased sensitivity to anthracycline-containing regimens.In a well characterized cohort of 96 primary invasive MBC, we studied CEP17, HER2 and Topo II-α alterations by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and expression of hormone receptors (HR), HER2 and Ki67 by immunohistochemistry to define molecular subtypes. Tumor characteristics and follow-up data were available and correlated with molecular findings.HER2 amplification and Topo II-α amplification/deletion were exceptionally rare in MBC (6.3% and 3.1%, respectively). CEP17 polysomy were found in 9.4% of tumors. HER2, Topo II-α and CEP17 gene alterations were not correlated to patients outcome. 96.9% of our cases were HR positive. Triple negative tumors were found in only 3.1% of the cases. In nodal negative tumors luminal A subtypes were significantly associated with better overall survival.Our results provide evidence for a predominant male breast cancer phenotype, characterized by HR expression and a lack of HER2/Topo II-α alterations and CEP17 duplicates. Therefore, the impact of anthracycline sensitivity linked to HER2/Topo II-α alterations as found in female breast cancer has low clinical significance for this specific male breast cancer phenotype. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon disease that has been the focus of limited research. It is estimated that approximately 10% of men with breast cancer have a genetic predisposition, with BRCA2 being the most prevalent genetic mutation. Here we describe the case of MBC in a 64-year-old man who presented on physical examination a nodule in his left breast and declared to have an extensive family history of cancer. Methods and results: The patient was firstly diagnosed with an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with histological grade III, nuclear grade 3, pT4N2Mx and positive for hormonal receptors and HER2. Exome sequencing was performed by massive parallel sequencing which had detected a novel BRCA2 germline mutation that is a large genomic deletion of 3,492 nucleotides including BRCA2 exon 14, and this deletion is out of frame and is predicted to lead to a stop codon in exon 15 at codon 2,496. Conclusion: Large rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 occur in a small percentage (< 1%) of patients tested for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. This is the first report of the mutation del3492 in BRCA2 exon 14, which leads to a truncated protein and therefore is clinically relevant. Mutation segregation analysis should be further done in the Brazilian population. Herein we highlight the importance of next-generation sequencing in the detection of large genomic deletions. © 2015 Timoteo et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare malignant disease, accounting for <1 % of all breast cancers (BCs). Treatment of men with early-stage BC is based on standards established in female BC. Prognostic or predictive markers to guide therapeutic decisions, in particular in early-stage male BC, are missing. Here, we explored whether disseminated tumor cells (DTC) in bone marrow (BM) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) in blood could be suitable biomarkers in male BC. Patients and methods: Five male patients (pT2–4, pN0–2, M0) with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, and ductal primary BC (median age 70 years, range 51–73) were enrolled in a prospective study of patients with early-stage breast cancer. Here, we analyze the male subgroup. DTC in BM were analyzed before therapy and identified by immunocytochemistry using the pancytokeratin antibody A45B/B3. Blood samples (10 ml) were analyzed for CTC using the AdnaTest BreastCancer (AdnaGen AG, Langenhagen, Germany). Results: DTC were found in three out of five male patients (60 %) with two DTC detected in one patient and one DTC detected in each of the other two patients. This is compared to a detection rate of 25–40 % in pooled analyses of female patients. CTC were only found in one of five patients. After a median follow-up time of 3 years (range 1–10 years), all patients were still alive and free of relapse. Conclusion: The prevalence of DTC and CTC in male BC seems comparable with female BC. No prognostic relevance could be documented in this small population. A prospective study or at least larger cases series will be required to assess the prognostic or predictive value of DTC and CTC in this rare disease. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Purpose: We examined the association between 5α-reductase inhibitors and male breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Study participants were men 40 to 85 years old, with prescription and medical coverage, enrolled in the United States IMS LifeLink™ Health Plan claims database between 2001 and 2009. Cases required a primary breast cancer diagnosis (ICD-9-CM 175.x) on 2 different dates and a procedural code for mastectomy or lumpectomy/partial mastectomy with evidence of continuous care (radiation/chemotherapy or diagnoses in 2 or more months). Eligible controls were within 5 years in age and had duration of prior health care enrollment within 6 weeks. Risk set sampling selected 20 controls per case. We assessed the rate ratio for male breast cancer with 5α-reductase inhibitor exposure using conditional logistic regression. Analyses were stratified by duration of health care enrollment before diagnosis (1 year or more, 2 years or more and 3 years or more), each incremental 180 and 365 days of cumulative 5α-reductase inhibitor exposure, and period specific time frames before diagnosis (years 1, 2 and 3). Results: We identified 339 breast cancer cases matched to 6,780 controls. No statistically significant associations were observed between 5α-reductase inhibitors and breast cancer regardless of exposure assessment before the index date (1 year or moredRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.34-1.45; 2 years or moredRR 0.59, 95% CI 0.24-1.48; or 3 years or moredRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27-2.10). Each subsequent 180 days (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67-1.53) and 365 days (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.45-2.37) of cumulative 5α-reductase inhibitor therapy and period specific rate ratios also showed null associations. Conclusions: The lack of an association in our study suggests that the development of breast cancer should not influence the prescribing of 5α-reductase inhibitor therapy. © 2013 by AMERICAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, INC.},

The lumps are easier to invade in the center and the majority of the cases are positive for metastatic lymph node, with the typical clinical manifestation as a painless mass in partial breast. MBC with an unknown primary tumor is rare and is often prone to misdiagnosis, resulting in a delay in correct treatment. Such a case is extremely significant for clinical reference. The current study presents a 58-year-old male who developed a painless mass in the left armpit and received armpit mass biopsy and pathological examination which showed glandular cancer, with a high possibility of mammary primary tumor. The patient was administered four cycles of paclitaxel plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy. However, three months later, the patient identified novel disseminated lymph nodes in the left armpit. The initial pathological section and paraffin blocks were re-examined and the patient was finally diagnosed with breast invasive ductal carcinoma based on the metastases pathology and immunohistochemical examination. No breast mass was found on physical examination of the patient and the tumor markers, including cancer antigen 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen, were normal. No primary tumors were observed in the mammography and PET-CT and the primary tumor was not found following the left breast modified radical mastectomy.},

	abstract = {Assessment of proliferation is important in female breast cancer and individual treatment decisions are based upon its results, especially in the luminal subgroups. Gene expression analyses fail to group male breast cancer into the intrinsic subgroups previously established in female breast cancer. Even though proliferation has been shown to divide male breast cancer into molecular subgroups with different prognoses, the clinical importance of proliferation markers has not yet been elucidated. Previous studies in male breast cancer have demonstrated contradictory results regarding the prognostic impact of histological grade and Ki-67, parameters strongly associated with proliferation. The aim of the present project was to study proliferation in male breast cancer by assessing other proliferation-related markers viz. cyclins A, B, D1 and mitotic count. A total of 197 male breast cancer cases with accessible paraffin-embedded material and outcome data were investigated. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed on tissue microarrays. Kaplan-Meier estimates and the Cox proportional regression models were used for survival analyses with breast cancer death as the event. The subset of patients with high expression of cyclin A (hazard ratio (HR) 3.7; P=0.001) and B (HR 2.7; P=0.02) demonstrated a poorer survival. Furthermore, high mitotic count was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer death (HR 2.5; P=0.01). In contrast, cyclin D1 overexpression was predictive of better breast cancer survival (HR 0.3; P=0.001). In conclusion, high levels of cyclin A and B expression and an elevated mitotic count result in a two to threefold higher risk for breast cancer death, whereas cyclin D1 overexpression halves the risk. The clinical utility of these proliferation markers needs further elucidation. © 2013 USCAP, Inc.},

Methods: The data of 86 patients treated for MBC from 1973 to 2010 are retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics and clinical information, including the date of diagnosis, treatment, clinical course, and the date and causes of death are routinely recorded. Results: Median follow-up was 66 months. Isolated local-regional recurrence and distant metastases were observed in 15 (17.4%) and 24 (34.1%) of the cases, respectively. The 5-year OS rate was 65.8%; the disease-free survival rate was 72.4%, and the LC rate was 89.7%. The prognostic factors influencing local relapse were the T stage (p=0.002) and the chest wall muscular invasion (p=0.027) in the univariate analysis. The prognostic factors influencing OS were the presence of a positive axillary lymph node (p=0.001) and the T stage (p=0.001) in the univariate analysis. The T stage (p=0.008) and node (N) stage (p=0.038) were significant prognostic factors for OS in the multivariate analyses. Also, the T stage (p=0.034) was found to be significant for LC. Conclusion: We found that only the tumor size and lymph node status were independent prognostic factors for survival. In addition, only the tumor size was an independent prognostic factor for locoregional relapse. Modified radical mastectomy and conservative surgical procedures had similar outcomes for LC. © 2013 Korean Breast Cancer Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background The use, effectiveness, and tolerability of tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, and trastuzumab in early and advanced male breast cancer were examined at a population level. Patients and Methods A total of 158 consecutively referred men with invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 were identified. Stage and prognostic factors were compared with a random sample of contemporary female patients. Survival outcomes were compared with a separate female cohort matched 2:1 by prognostic and treatment factors. Results Men were older (median 69.5 years) than women (median 60 years) and presented with more advanced stage disease. Estrogen receptor was positive in 96% (n = 152) of cases. Tamoxifen was more commonly used than aromatase inhibitors in the curative and metastatic settings. Adherence to adjuvant tamoxifen therapy was generally adequate with estimated actuarial rates of persistence at 1 year and 3.5 years of 89% and 70%, respectively. For the 146 men treated with curative intent, 5-year overall survival, breast cancer-specific survival and progression-free survival were 72%, 86%, and 62%, respectively. Outcomes were similar to matched female patients in univariate and multivariate analyses. Conclusions In this large population-based study, outcomes appear similar between male and risk-matched female patients with breast cancer. Side effect profiles, tolerance, adherence, and outcomes after tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, and trastuzumab in men appear comparable with those described in the literature for women. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare and poorly understood. Like female breast cancer (FBC), MBCs are highly sensitive to hormonal changes, and hyperestrogenism, specifically, represents a major risk factor for MBC. MBC is considered similar to late-onset, post-menopausal estrogen/progesteron receptors positive FBC (ER+/PR+). Sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of estrogens. Recently, SULT1A1 common functional polymorphism Arg213His (638G>A) variant has been found to be associated with increased breast cancer (BC) risk, particularly in post-menopausal women. For this reason, we decided to explore whether SULT1A1 Arg213His could exert an effect on MBC development. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the SULT1A1 Arg213His polymorphism on MBC risk. The secondary aim was to investigate possible associations with relevant clinical–pathologic features of MBC. A total of 394 MBC cases and 786 healthy male controls were genotyped for SULT1A1 Arg213His polymorphism by PCR–RFLP and high-resolution melting analysis. All MBC cases were characterized for relevant clinical–pathologic features. A significant difference in the distribution of SULT1A1 Arg213His genotypes was found between MBC cases and controls (P < 0.0001). The analysis of genotype-specific risk showed a significant increased MBC risk in individuals with G/A (OR 1.97, 95 % CI 1.50–2.59; P < 0.0001) and A/A (OR 3.09, 95 % CI 1.83–5.23; P < 0.0001) genotypes in comparison to wild-type genotype, under co-dominant model. A significant association between SULT1A1 risk genotypes and HER2 status emerged. Results indicate that SULT1A1 Arg213His may act as a low-penetrance risk allele for developing MBC and could be associated with a specific tumor subtype associated with HER2 overexpression. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is an uncommon malignancy; little is known regarding hormonal manipulations for tamoxifen-resistant male breast cancer patients. This is the first pooled analysis of the literature to synthesize all available data and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant in male breast cancer. This study was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. All studies that examined the efficacy of fulvestrant in male breast cancer, regardless of sample size, were considered eligible. The search strategy retrieved 31 articles; of these, five articles were eligible (23 patients) for this pooled analysis. The mean age of the study sample was 63.1 years. Adjuvant hormonal treatment was administered in 87.5 % of cases. Fulvestrant was given as first or second line in 40 % of patients, while as third line or beyond in 60 % of patients. 79.0 % of patients at fulvestrant administration had visceral metastases. Regarding best response, in 26.1 % PR was achieved, in 47.8 % of cases SD was recorded, whereas in 26.1 % of patients PD was noted. The median PFS was equal to 5 months. No grade 3 and 4 adverse events were recorded; of note, hot flashes were reported in 18.2 % of male breast cancer patients. Fulvestrant may potentially play a promising role in the optimal therapeutic strategy for male patients with breast cancer diagnosis. However, further clinical and pharmacokinetic investigations are more than warranted before fulvestrant use becomes a common practice in male breast cancer patients. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Follow-up enhanced computed tomography in 2011 showed a 7 mm diameter tumor in the left breast, and the tumor subsequently increased to 13 mm in diameter after six months. We suspected that the breast tumor was a primary or metastatic carcinoma from renal cancer. Ultrasonography demonstrated the features of the tumor, which were a wellcircumscribed hypoechoic mass with abundant vascularity. The findings of core needle biopsy suggested a metastatic breast tumor from clear cell carcinoma. Male breast cancer is rare, accounting for less than 1 % of all breast cancer cases. Furthermore, metastatic male breast cancer is an extremely unusual disease. It is known that the primary tumors of metastatic breast cancer are contralateral breast cancer, gastric cancer, leukemia, and malignant lymphoma. However, renal cell carcinoma has been rarely reported.

	abstract = {Despite male breast cancer is rare in occurrence, it is a serious problem. In 2012, 130 men in Ukraine got breast cancer that constituted 0.74% from all patients with mentioned pathology detected in the course of year. Every year in Ukraine approximately 100 men die from breast cancer. Still many aspects of male breast cancer remain unstudied. It occurs since information about mentioned disease is mainly based on retrospective analysis of small groups. Treatment of men, who got breast cancer, is based on knowledge, which has been obtained in treatment of women with this pathology. This article is based on the results of analysis of 168 cases of breast cancer in men, who have been examined and treated in the period from 1956 to 2012. In paper the peculiarities of clinical manifestations of male breast cancer have been determined, the optimal volume of diagnostic procedures in men with suspicion of breast cancer has been established, the mammographic signs have been detected and the possible histological variants of disease have been determined, clinical course peculiarities of male breast cancer have been defined, the most essential factors of prognosis of the disease have been fixed. Furthermore, in article optimal volume of surgical treatment of male breast cancer has been substantiated, the role and place of radiotherapy in treatment of this pathology has been determined. It has been proved that adjuvant polychemotherapy should be applied to the patients with male breast cancer independently from stage of process. Also optimal schemes of this kind of treatment have been determined. The efficacy of hormonal therapy with antiestrogen in patients with positive receptors of steroid hormones and at presence of unfavorable prognostic factors of disease has been demonstrated. The inefficiency of orchiectomy as one of the widespread kinds of hormonal therapy of male breast cancer has been defined. Copyright © Experimental Oncology, 2013.},

Although estrogen exposure has been causally linked to the development of female breast cancers, the etiology of male breast cancer is unclear. Here, we show via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) that the Y chromosome was clonally lost at a frequency of ~16% (5/31) in two independent cohorts of male breast cancer patients. We also show somatic loss of the Y chromosome gene TMSB4Y in a male breast tumor, confirming prior reports of loss at this locus in male breast cancers. To further understand the function of TMSB4Y, we created inducible cell lines of TMSB4Y in the female human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A. Expression of TMSB4Y resulted in aberrant cellular morphology and reduced cell proliferation, with a corresponding reduction in the fraction of metaphase cells. We further show that TMSB4Y interacts directly with Β-actin, the main component of the actin cytoskeleton and a cell cycle modulator. Taken together, our results suggest that clonal loss of the Y chromosome may contribute to male breast carcinogenesis, and that the TMSB4Y gene has tumor suppressor properties.},

Black patients were more likely to be diagnosed at younger age (P<0.001), have advanced stage disease (P=0.001), and be unmarried (P<0.001) and less likely to undergo lymph node dissection (P=0.006). When stratified by stage, there was no difference in receipt of primary treatment by race. The 5-year OS for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian races was 73.8%, 66.3%, 74.0%, and 85.3% (P<0.001). This significant worse 5-year OS for Blacks persisted regardless of age, stage II or III disease, and grade 2 or 3 disease. On multivariate analysis, Black race was a significant independent prognostic factor for worse OS. Blacks were less likely to receive lymph node dissection of which patients may derive benefit, though we did not observe receipt of primary treatment, after stratifying for disease stage, to be an underlying factor contributing to racial outcome differences. © 2014 Jacob Y.

	abstract = {Background: Less than 1% of all breast cancer cases are found in men, who reportedly have inferior outcomes compared with matched women patients. Ethnic differences may also affect their prognosis. Here, we investigated overall survival (OS) and major prognostic factors for male breast cancer (MBC) in a cohort of Egyptian patients.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed OS in a cohort of 69 male patients with MBC who were surgically treated at the Mansoura Cancer Center, Egypt between 2000 and 2007. We registered demographic data, age, height, weight and body mass index, tumor size, histology, number of infiltrated axillary lymph nodes, hormone receptor (HR) status and metastatic presence, and TNM staging. Patients' OS was the primary endpoint. Patients received treatment to the medical standards at the time of their diagnosis.Results: In the 69 patients who met the inclusion criteria and had complete stored patient data, tumors ranged from T1c to T3. We could gather cancer-related survival data from only 56 patients. The collective 5-year survival in this cohort was 46.4%. Only five patients had distant metastasis at diagnosis, but they showed a null percent 5-year survival, whereas those with no lymph node infiltration showed a 100% 5-year survival. Lymph node status and tumor grading were the only prognostic factors that significantly affected OS.Conclusions: Lymph node status and tumor grade are the most important prognostic factors for overall survival of MBC in Egyptian male patients; whereas even remarkably low HR expression in MBC did not significantly affect OS. Further research is needed to understand the factors that affect this disease. © 2014 Soliman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer is a rare malignancy. Despite the lack of prospectively generated data from trials in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting, patients are commonly treated with hormone therapies. Much controversy exists over the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues in metastatic male breast cancer patients. We conducted this study to provide more concrete ground on the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues in this setting. Methods: We herein present results from a pooled analysis including 60 metastatic male breast cancer patients treated with either an aromatase inhibitor or cyproterone acetate as a monotherapy (23 patients) or combined with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (37 patients). Results: Overall response rate was 43.5 % in patients treated with monotherapy and 51.3 % with combination therapy (p = 0.6). Survival outcomes favored combination therapy in terms of median progression-free survival (11.6 months versus 6 months; p = 0.05), 1-year progression-free survival rate (43.2 % versus 21.7 %; p = 0.05), median overall survival (29.7 months versus 22 months; p = 0.05), and 2-year survival rate (64.9 % versus 43.5 %; p = 0.05). Conclusions: In metastatic male breast cancer patients, the combined use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and aromatase inhibitors or antiandrogens seems to be associated with greater efficacy, particularly in terms of survival outcomes, compared with monotherapy. Collectively, these results encourage considering these agents in the metastatic setting. © 2015 Di Lauro et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

	abstract = {Background: It is assumed that lymphatic vessels are responsible for breast cancer dissemination. Patients and Methods: In 32 male breast carcinomas we evaluated the correlation between: (i) lymphatic vessel density (LVD), distribution of podoplanin-immunostained vessels (DPV), blood vessel density (BVD), infiltration of immune cells and (ii) known clinicopathological parameters. Results: Lymphatic and blood vessels were found in 77.8% and 100% of breast carcinomas, respectively. Double-negative estrogen and progesterone receptor tumors (ER-/PR-) presented significantly higher LVD than ER/PR positive cases, while high-grade tumors exhibited significantly higher DPV than low-grade carcinomas. We detected significantly higher frequency of vascular invasion in high-grade and double-negative carcinomas than in low-grade and ER/PR-positive ones, respectively. Conclusion: The relationship between high number of lymphatic vessels and high tumor grade or steroid receptor negativity might confirm the hypothesis regarding the influence of lymphangiogenesis on the formation of a more aggressive phenotype in male breast cancer. © 2015, International Institute of Anticancer Research.

	abstract = {Objective: Androgen receptor (AR) plays an important role in male breast cancer (MBC). Additionally, endocrine therapy is the most important treatment in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive advanced breast cancer. This study was aimed to investigate the role of AR in MBC treatment and prognosis and to analyse the relationship between AR and the effect of tamoxifen treatment in MBC patients.; Methods: AR protein levels and other tumour characteristics (e.g. expression of ER (ESR1), PR (PGR), AR, HER2 (ERBB2) and Ki-67 (MKI67)) in breast cancer tissue from 102 MBC patients were determined using immunohistochemical analysis. Additionally, the relationship between AR status and clinicopathological features was analysed using the c2-test. Association with survival was initially analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis was used to adjust for other prognostic indicators.; Results: High expression of AR was not correlated with T-stage, histological grade, HER2 status and the status of other sex hormone receptors, but was associated with lymph node metastases (PZ0.032). AR-positive patients showed significantly shorter 5-year overall survival (OS) rates (PZ0.045) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates (PZ0.026) than AR-negative patients. By contrast, for patients who received tamoxifen therapy, AR-negative patients showed a higher clinical benefit rate than AR-positive patients (PZ0.025). Additionally, the median TTP and OS were significantly different (PZ0.02 for TTP; PZ0.029 for OS).; Conclusions: AR expression correlates strongly with both OS and DFS in patients with MBC. AR-positive patients can predict a poorer clinical outcome than AR-negative patients after adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. © 2014 European Society of Endocrinology.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer occurs very rare accounts for about 0.2-1% of all male cancers. The ratio of the breast cancer incidence in male and female patients is approximately 1:100. Median age of breast cancer initiation in males is 67 – 71 years of age, that is 5 – 10 years later than that in women. The main risk factors of male breast cancer include hormonal abnormalities, particularly hyperestrogenia, congenital factors and radiation. Male breast carcinoma demonstrates strong estrogen and progesterone expression, as determined by the IHC staining: 91 and 76%, respectively. These numbers are much higher than those in female patients. Hyperexpression and amplification of Her-2/neu gene is also an essential feature for male breast carcinoma. There are very limited data available on metastatic progression of male breast carcinoma. One study evaluated 127 cases of male breast cancer, and distant metastatic affection was seen in 32% cases, among them distant metastases were most frequently situated in bones. There are also reports about metastases in lungs, liver and skin, but their incidence is so low, that these reports are not analyzed and described in details by their authors. There are some reports of unusual metastatic locations. For instance, a metastatic tumor growth in mandibular joint was reported in 73-year-old male patient with ductal breast cancer in March 2012. Earlier, in 2010, the same group described a metastasis in paranasal sinus. Here we report a very rare occurrence of a brain metastatic disease in a male breast carcinoma patient. Based on literary data we found only two previously published case reports of similar disease development. However, we believe that investigation of single cases of brain metastases in patients with male breast cancer and determination of characteristic features for such disease progression will allow us to find optimal strategies for application of various therapy options including chemotherapy and hormone-therapy in the treatment of this category of patients. © 2014, Yerevan State Medical University.

	abstract = {Aim: To assess whether prognostic factors in male (MBC) and female (FBC) breast cancer have similar impact on survival. Patients and Methods: Charts for men and women diagnosed with breast cancer referred to the London Regional Cancer Program (LRCP) were reviewed. Patients with distant metastatic diseases were excluded. Data on prognostic factors including age, nodal status, resection margin, use of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy with/without hormone and radiation therapy (RT), overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed. Survival estimates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier methodology. The Cox regression interaction was used to compare male and female differences in prognostic factors. Results: From 1963-2006 there were 75 cases of MBC and 1,313 of FBC totaling in 1,388 breast cancer cases. The median age of the cohort was 53 (range=23-90) years. The median follow-up was 90 (range=0.4-339) months. Of the prognostic factors considered, nodal status had a significant Cox regression interaction. For OS, p=0.001 with hazard ratios of 0.83 (95% confidence interval CI=0.42-1.64) and 2.88 (95% CI=2.36- 3.52) for males and females, respectively. For CSS p=0.041 with hazard ratios of 1.22 (95% CI=0.45-3.27) and 3.52 (95% CI=2.76-4.48) for males and females, respectively. For node-positive cases, distant disease recurrence-free survival was worse for MBC (log rank, p<0.001). Conclusion: This large series showed that the nodal status influences survival differently in MBC and FBC. The findings of this study need confirmation from a more complete prospective database and further investigations on improving high-risk node-positive MBC management are warranted.},

	abstract = {Background Male breast cancer (bc) is a rare disease, and the availability of information on treatment outcomes is limited compared with that for female bc. The objective of the present study was to compare disease-free (dfs) and overall survival (os) for men compared with women having early-stage bc. Methods This retrospective case-control study compared men and women treated for stage 0-iiib bc at a single institution between 1981 and 2009. Matching was based on age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and stage. Treatment, recurrence, and survival data were collected. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate os and dfs. Results For the 144 eligible patients (72 men, 72 women), median age at diagnosis was 66.5 years. Treatments included mastectomy (72 men, 38 women), radiation (29 men, 44 women), chemotherapy (23 men, 20 women), and endocrine therapy (57 men, 57 women). Mean dfs was 127 months for women compared with 93 months for men (p = 0.62). Mean os was 117 months for women compared with 124 months for men (p = 0.35). In multivariate analysis, the only parameter that affected both dfs and os was stage at diagnosis. Conclusions This case-control study is one of the largest to report treatment outcomes in early-stage male bc patients treated in a non-trial setting. Male patients received systemic therapy that was comparable to that received by their female counterparts, and they had similar os and dfs. These results add to current evidence from population studies that male sex is not a poor prognostic factor in early-stage breast cancer. © 2014 Multimed Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic male breast cancer patients remains unknown, and the only available evidence stem from small, retrospective series evaluating outdated drugs and/or regimens. Methods: In this retrospective study we evaluated the activity of polychemotherapy, consisting of three-drug (anthracycline-containing and anthracycline-free) regimens, as a first-line therapy for metastatic male breast cancer patients who had received at least one prior endocrine therapy. Results: Fifty patients treated between 1978 and 2013 were included in the present analysis. Regarding best response, we recorded 1 (2%) complete response and 27 (54%) partial responses, for an overall response rate of 56% (95% CI, 42.2-69.8). Considering stable disease, the disease control rate was 84%. Median progression-free survival was 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.9-8.5), and median overall survival was 14.2 months (95% CI, 12.2-16.2). Albeit we observed some differences for all the outcomes explored when comparing anthracycline-containing and anthracycline-free regimens, they were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Chemotherapy, consisting in both anthracycline-containing and anthracycline-free regimens, showed encouraging antitumor activity in metastatic male breast cancer patients previously treated with endocrine therapy. © 2015 Di Lauro et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to analyze the demographic and clinical characteristics of male breast cancer patients in Serbia, and furthermore to determine overall survival and predictive factors for prognosis. Materials and Methods: In the period of 1996-2006 histopathological diagnosis of breast cancer was made in 84 males at the Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia. For statistical analyses the Kaplan-Meier method, long-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used. Results: The mean age at diagnosis with breast cancer was 64.3±10.5 years with a range from 35-84 years. Nearly 80% of the tumors showed ductal histology. About 44% had early tumor stages (I and II) whereas 46.4% and 9.5% of the male exhibitied stages III and IV, respectively. Only 7.1% of male patients were grade one. One-fifth of all patients had tumors measuring ≤2 cm, and 14.3% larger than 5 cm. Lymph node metastasis was recorded in 40.4% patients and 47% relapse. Estrogen and progesterone receptor expression was positive in 66.7% and 58.3%, respectively. Among 14.3% of individuals tumor was HER2 positive. About two-thirds of all male patients had radical mastectomy (66.7%). Adjuvant hormonal (tamoxifene), systematic chemotherapy (CMF or FAC) and adjuvant radiotherapy were given to 59.5%, 35.7% and 29.8% patients respectively. Overall survival rates at five and ten years for male breast cancer were 55.0% and 43.9%, respectively. According to the multivariate Cox regression predictive model, a lower initial disease stage, a lower tumor grade, application of adjuvant hormone therapy and no relapse occurrence were significant independent predictors for good overall survival. Conclusions: Results of the treatment would be better if disease is discovered earlier and therefore health education and screening are an imperative in solving this problem.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare condition that accounts for 0.1% of all male cancers. Our current evidence base for treatment is derived from female breast cancer (FBC) patients. Risk factors for MBC include age, genetic predisposition, race, sex hormone exposure, and environmental factors. Most patients present later and with more advanced disease than comparable FBC patients. Tumors are likely to be estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive, with the most common histologic type being invasive ductal carcinoma. Triple assessment remains the criterion standard for diagnosis. Primary MBC is mostly managed initially by simple mastectomy, with the option of breast conserving surgery, which carries an increased risk of recurrence. Sentinel node biopsy is recommended as the initial procedure for staging the axilla. Reconstructive surgery focuses on achieving primary skin closure, and radiotherapy largely follows treatment protocols validated in FBC. We recommend chemotherapy for men with more advanced disease, in particular, those with estrogen receptor negative histology. MBC responds well to endocrine therapy, although it is associated with significant adverse effects. Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are promising but raise concerns due to their failure to prevent estrogen synthesis in the testes. Fulvestrant remains unproven as a therapy, and data on trastuzumab is equivocal with HER2 receptor expression and functionality unclear in MBC. In metastatic disease, drug-based hormonal manipulation remains a first-line therapy, followed by systemic chemotherapy for hormone-refractory disease. Prognosis for MBC has improved over the past 30 years, with survival affected by disease staging, histologic classification, and comorbidity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although several studies have shown the efficacy of third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in women with breast cancer, the role of such molecules remains elusive in male breast cancer patients. It is also unknown whether the addition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues to AIs would be a superior strategy or not. This pooled analysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. All studies that examined the efficacy of AIs in metastatic male breast cancer were considered eligible. Overall, 15 studies (105 cases) were eligible for this pooled analysis. The mean age of the study sample was 62.8 years. ER status was positive in all eligible cases. AI was given as first line in 61.5 % of cases. GnRH analogue was co-administered with AI in 37.1 % of cases (n = 39). CR, PR, SD and PD were achieved in 5.7, 23.8, 37.2 and 33.3 % of cases, respectively. The median PFS and OS were equal to 10.0 and 39.0 months, respectively. Co-administration of GnRH analogues was associated with more than threefold increase in rates of clinical benefit (OR = 3.37, 95 % CI 1.30–8.73) but did not seem to correlate with better PFS or OS. No statistically significant associations between the examined outcomes and the other parameters were noted. Available data suggest that AIs may potentially play a promising role in the optimal therapeutic strategy for metastatic male breast cancer patients. Especially, co-administration of AI with a GnRH analogue seems to increase the rate of clinical benefit and could be more effective, warranting further consideration. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Purpose: We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the management and outcome of invasive male breast cancer treated in a single-institution over a period of 40 years. Materials and methods: We reviewed the clinical and pathological features of 60 male patients affected by breast carcinoma treated at our Radiotherapy Unit between 1971 and 2011. Tumours were classified according to histological type and the updated 2010 TNM classification of malignant tumours. Results: At a median follow-up of 8.9 [range, 0.6-20; standard deviation (SD), 4.98] years, 32 patients (53.3%) were alive and 16 patients died (26.7%) due to disease progression and 12 (20%) due to other causes. At univariate analysis for overall survival, pathological tumour size (p=0.031), histological subtype (p=0.013) and nodal status (p=0.006) emerged as significant predictors of death. At multivariate analysis, independent death predictors were advanced pathological tumour size (p=0.016), positive nodal status (p=0.003) and invasive cribriform histological type (p=0.0003). Conclusions: In consideration of the rarity of the disease, many issues are still being debated, and future collaborative studies are required. However, our experience confirms the prognostic role of greater pathological tumour size and positive nodal status as unfavourable features for survival in male breast cancer. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Italia.},

The primary aim of this study was to assess RS distribution in Israeli male breast cancer (MBC) patients. Methods: The study population included 65 newly diagnosed Israeli MBC patients. Clinical and pathologic data were collected at the time of referral. Pathologic examinations were conducted at the pathology departments of the referring centers. The RS assay (Oncotype DX™) was performed on paraffin-embedded tumor samples at Genomic Health laboratories. Results: The mean age of the patients was 65.1 years (range 38-88 years). Low-risk (RS <18), intermediate-risk (RS 18-30) and high-risk (RS ≥31) scores were noted in 29 patients (44.6%), 27 patients (41.5%) and 9 patients (13.9%), respectively. The distribution of RS in male patients was similar to the distribution in 2,455 female patients from Israel referred during the same time period. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the distribution of Oncotype DX RS in ER-positive MBC patients is similar to that of female breast cancer patients. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

We report successful computed tomographic lymphography (CTLG)-guided SLNB in two male breast cancer cases: the first patient was a 79-year-old man and the second was a 64-year-old man. Both had presented with a lump behind the nipple. Clinical diagnoses were early breast carcinoma in both cases. The second patient took tamoxifen 20 mg daily as neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. SLNs were clearly visualized by CTLG, allowing mastectomies with SLNB to be performed. Both SLNB were negative, such that axillary lymph node dissection was not needed. Preoperative CTLG is useful for visualizing lymph flow and detecting SLN in male breast cancer. © 2013 Hashimoto et al.},

	abstract = {Background and study design: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease compared with female BC and our current understanding regarding breast carcinogenesis in men has been largely extrapolated from the female counterpart. We focus on differences between the ethical issues related to male and female BC patients. A systematic literature search by using PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), was carried out to provide a synopsis of the current research in the field of MBC genetics, epigenetics and ethics. Original articles and reviews published up to September 2012 were selected by using the following search key words to query the PubMed website: 'male breast cancer', 'male breast cancer and genetic susceptibility', 'male breast cancer and epigenetics', 'male breast cancer and methylation', 'male breast cancer and miRNA', 'male breast cancer and ethics'. Results and conclusions: As in women, three classes of breast cancer genetic susceptibility (high, moderate, and low penetrance) are recognized in men. However, genes involved and their impact do not exactly overlap in female and male BC. Epigenetic alterations are currently scarcely investigated in MBC, however, the different methylation and miRNA expression profiles identified to date in female and male BCs suggest a potential role for epigenetic alterations as diagnostic biomarkers. Overall, much still needs to be learned about MBC and, because of its rarity, the main effort is to develop large consortia for moving forward in understanding MBC and improving the management of MBC patients on a perspective of gender medicine. © The Author 2013.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare form of carcinoma with an incidence rate of approximately 0.5-1% compared with cases of breast carcinoma as a whole. Male breast cancer reacts effectively to endocrine therapy because of a high frequency of hor-mone receptor expression. The aim of the present study was the assessment of correlations between stage, grade, expression of steroid receptors, basal/mesenchymal markers and proliferation index, as well as analysis of the impact of the above-mentioned parameters on overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in the group of 32 male breast cancer patients, treated at the Centre of Oncology in Cracow. We showed the significant positive correlation between MIB-1 LI and tumor stage, and hormone receptors (ER or PgR) immunonegativity, and expression of EGFR, vimentin (p<0.05) and P-cadherin (the last at statistical border). Te presence of any of basal or masenchymal markers correlated with a more advanced tumor stage. Moreover tumors without vimentin expression were characterised by lower MIB-1 LI and were more frequently EGFR immunonegative. We found that hormone receptor negativity, vimentin immunopositivity and high MIB-1 LI are significant independent indicators of poor OS and DFS for male breast cancer patients (p<0.05).},

	abstract = {SULT1A1, a member of sulfotransferase superfamily, is a drug and hormone metabolizing enzyme involved in the metabolism of a variety of potential mammary carcinogens of endogenous and exogenous origin. Interestingly, the metabolic activity of SULT1A1 can be affected by variations in gene copy number. Male Breast Cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and less investigated disease compared to female BC (FBC). As in FBC, the concurrent effects of genetic risk factors, particularly BRCA2 mutations, increased exposure to estrogens and environmental carcinogens play a relevant role in MBC. By quantitative real-time PCR with TaqMan probes, we investigated the presence of SULT1A1 gene copy number variations (CNVs) in a series of 72 MBCs. SULT1A1 gene deletion was observed in 10 of the 72 MBCs (13.9%). In a multivariate analysis association between BRCA2 mutation and SULT1A1 gene deletion emerged (p = 0.0005). Based on the evidence that the level of SULT1A1 enzyme activity is correlated with CNV, our data suggest that in male breast tumors SULT1A1 activity may be decreased. Thus, it can be hypothesized that in a proportion of MBCs, particularly in BRCA2-associated MBCs, the level of estrogens and environmental carcinogens exposure might be increased suggesting a link between gene and environmental exposure in the pathogenesis of MBC. © 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease, accounting for ∼1% of all breast cancer cases worldwide. Although other genes are also involved, predisposing genetic factors to MBC include germline mutations in the BRCA genes (BRCA2). Among the other genes, partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) is considered a moderate-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility gene that may also play a role in MBC predisposition. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the PALB2 gene status in 8 MBC cases selected from a cohort of 181 hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer probands. We performed PALB2 mutational analysis by direct sequencing of 13 exons and adjacent intronic regions. This study showed the presence of a PALB2 truncating mutation in 1/8 (12.5%) cases. This novel mutation was named c.1285-1286delAinsTC (p.I429SfsX12) and is localized in exon 4 of PALB2, in the region encoding for the ChAM motif which is important for the efficient association of PALB2 to chromatin and for recruitment of the BRCA complex to accumulate RAD51 at double-strand break sites. Our findings indicate that PALB2 could be added to the list of breast cancer susceptibility genes also in families with MBC cases.},

	abstract = {Background. Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon disease and there is limited information on the prognostic impact of routinely used clinicopathological parameters. Material and methods. In a retrospective setting, we reviewed 197 MBC patients with accessible paraffin-embedded tumor tissue and clinicopathological data. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stainings were performed on tissue microarrays and histological grading on conventional slides. Cox proportional regression models were applied for uni- and multivariate analyses using breast cancer death as the event. Results. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor positivity were demonstrated in 93% and 77% of patients, respectively. Nottingham histologic grade (NHG) III was seen in 41% and HER2 positivity in 11%. Classification into molecular subtypes using IHC markers according to three alternative definitions revealed luminal A and luminal B in 81% vs. 11%; 48% vs. 44% and 41% vs. 42% of cases. Two cases of basal-like were identified, but no cases of HER2-like. Factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer death were node positivity (HR 4.5; 95% CI 1.8-11.1), tumor size >20 mm (HR 3.3; 95% CI 1.4-7.9) and ER negativity (HR 10.9; 95% CI 3.2-37.9). No difference in breast cancer death between the luminal subgroups was demonstrated, regardless of definition. Conclusion. MBC tumors were more often of high grade, whereas HER2 overexpression was as frequent as in FBC. Lymph nodes, tumor size and ER status were independent predictors of breast cancer death. The prognostic impact of molecular subtyping in MBC seems to differ from that previously established in FBC. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.},

	abstract = {We used to LASSO-Cox method for determining prognostic factors of male breast cancer survival and showed the superiority of this method compared to Cox proportional hazard model in low sample size setting. In order to identify and estimate exactly the relative hazard of the most important factors effective for the survival duration of male breast cancer, the LASSO-Cox method has been used. Our data includes the information of male breast cancer patients in Fars province, south of Iran, from 1989 to 2008. Cox proportional hazard and LASSO-Cox models were fitted for 20 classified variables. To reduce the impact of missing data, the multiple imputation method was used 20 times through the Markov chain Mont Carlo method and the results were combined with Rubin's rules. In 50 patients, the age at diagnosis was 59.6 (SD=12.8) years with a minimum of 34 and maximum of 84 years and the mean of survival time was 62 months. Three, 5 and 10 year survival were 92%, 77% and 26%, respectively. Using the LASSO-Cox method led to eliminating 8 low effect variables and also decreased the standard error by 2.5 to 7 times. The relative efficiency of LASSO-Cox method compared with the Cox proportional hazard method was calculated as 22.39. The19 years follow of male breast cancer patients show that the age, having a history of alcohol use, nipple discharge, laterality, histological grade and duration of symptoms were the most important variables that have played an effective role in the patient's survival. In such situations, estimating the coefficients by LASSO-Cox method will be more efficient than the Cox's proportional hazard method.},

	abstract = {Background The etiology of male breast cancer is poorly understood, partly because of its relative rarity. Although genetic factors are involved, less is known regarding the role of anthropometric and hormonally related risk factors. Methods In the Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project, a consortium of 11 case-control and 10 cohort investigations involving 2405 case patients (n = 1190 from case-control and n = 1215 from cohort studies) and 52 013 control subjects, individual participant data were harmonized and pooled. Unconditional logistic regression generated study design-specific (case-control/cohort) odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with exposure estimates combined using fixed effects meta-analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results Risk was statistically significantly associated with weight (highest/lowest tertile: OR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.57), height (OR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.38), and body mass index (BMI; OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.51), with evidence that recent rather than distant BMI was the strongest predictor. Klinefelter syndrome (OR = 24.7; 95% CI = 8.94 to 68.4) and gynecomastia (OR = 9.78; 95% CI = 7.52 to 12.7) were also statistically significantly associated with risk, relations that were independent of BMI. Diabetes also emerged as an independent risk factor (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.37). There were also suggestive relations with cryptorchidism (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 0.96 to 4.94) and orchitis (OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.99). Although age at onset of puberty and histories of infertility were unrelated to risk, never having had children was statistically significantly related (OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.66). Among individuals diagnosed at older ages, a history of fractures was statistically significantly related (OR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.86). Conclusions Consistent findings across case-control and cohort investigations, complemented by pooled analyses, indicated important roles for anthropometric and hormonal risk factors in the etiology of male breast cancer. Further investigation should focus on potential roles of endogenous hormones. © The Author 2014.},

Searches were carried out on PubMed using the title terms 'male breast cancer' or 'male breast carcinoma'.Results: Relevant published data regarding risk factors, biological characteristics, presentation and prognosis,appropriate evaluation and treatment, and survivorship issues in male breast cancer patients are presented. BRCA2 mutations, age, conditions that alter the estrogen/androgen ratio, and radiation are proven risk factors. Disease biology is distinct in men, but diagnostic approaches and treatments for men are generally extrapolated from those in women due to inadequate research in men. Survivorship issues in men may include sexual and hormonal side-effects of endocrine therapies as well as unique psychosocial impacts of the disease.Conclusion: Further research is needed to address gaps in knowledge pertaining to care of male breast cancer patients and survivors. © The Author 2013.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Male breast cancer (BC) is a rare disease, with patterns different from those found in women. Most tumors are detected at more advanced stages than in women. The aim of this study was to analyze the performance of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) in staging, restaging, and therapy response assessment.; METHODS: We performed a systematic analysis in the database of Saint-Louis Hospital to identify male patients with BC referred for PET/CT. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT findings considered suspicious for malignancy were compared to biopsy results, further work-up and/or patient follow-up of at least 6 months. Performances of (18)F-FDG-PET/CT were compared to that of conventional imaging (CI) using the McNemar test. The impact of PET/CT on management was evaluated.; RESULTS: During 6 consecutive years, among 12,692 (18)F-FDG-PET/CT oncology studies, 30 were performed in 15 men with BC: 7 examinations for initial staging, 11 for restaging, and 12 for response assessment. Tumors profile was ER+ and one had HER2 overexpression. PET/CT sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy to detect distant metastases were 100%, 67%, 86%, 100% and 89%, respectively. PET/CT was more informative than CI in 40% of studies (p=0.03; 95% confidence interval: 3.26 - 40%). Findings from (18)F-FDG-PET/CT led to modification in the planned treatment in 13/30 cases (43%).; CONCLUSION: Although all the tumors were ER+, primary lesions and metastases were diagnosed with high sensitivity. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT seems to be a powerful imaging method to perform staging, restaging and treatment response assessment in male patients with BC. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {Objective: Male breast cancer is a rare disease with an incidence of about 1% of breast cancers in USA, but relatively lack of the information of male breast cancer in China, especially in Southwest of China, led us to study its incidence trends. Methods: Chongqing is one of the biggest and the most important areas that is located in Southwest of China. There are around 31.4 million people who live in approximate 82 402.95 km2 area of Chongqing. Data about breast cancer patients registered in the Center for Disease Prevention and Control of Chongqing (China) were statistically collected from 187 hospitals, about 58 hospitals in city and 129 hospitals in country, and over 6.2 million people were studied every year. It was tried to represent all the people in villages and cities in Chongqing, China. Results: The incidence of male breast cancer in Southwest of China ranged from 0.34/100 000 to 1.45/100 000 between 2007 and 2011, while the incidence of female breast cancer ranged from 15.40/100000 to 21.66/100000 at the same time. The rate of male breast cancer to female breast cancer ranged from 0.02:1 to 0.07:1, male breast cancer accounted for 1.96% to 6.5% (with the mean value of 2.9%) of breast cancers in Southwest of China from 2007 to 2010. Conclusion: In Southwest of China male breast cancer accounts for about 2.9% of breast cancers which is higher than that in United States. It is important for policy makers and health manager to seriously consider breast cancer in future plan in Southwest of China. © Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

At present, OC is a morphological entity, and there is no practical reason for including OC into everyday reports, since any significant clinical features are found. However, more cases of OC of the breast have to be studied in view of the fact that oncocytic tumors of colon, thyroid, and meninges seem to be resistant to radiation therapy, a finding that might be taken into consideration when planning the treatment in breast carcinomas. © sociation of Surgeons of India 2012.},

	abstract = {Background Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for approximately 1% of all breast cancers. Given the rarity of this disease, treatment of MBC generally follows the same principles as treatment of female breast cancer. However, the traditional surgical approach for MBC is modified radical mastectomy (MRM) or total simple mastectomy (TSM) instead of breast conservation surgery (BCS). The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of BCS as an alternative to mastectomy for MBC with respect to musculoskeletal functionality and treatment outcome. Patients and Methods A retrospective analysis was undertaken of all male patients with breast cancer who presented to Massachusetts General Hospital or Boston Medical Center for localized therapy from 1990 to 2003. Musculoskeletal functionality (tissue fibrosis, arm edema, and range of motion) and treatment outcome (local-regional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival) were evaluated. Functional/cosmetic outcomes were assessed by multidisciplinary review of patient follow-up visits and were scored as either "good-excellent" or "fair-poor" to account for subjectivity between different clinicians. Results Forty-two patients in total were identified to undergo localized treatment. Thirty patients (71%) received MRM, 4 (10%) had TSM, and 8 (19%) underwent BCS. Actuarial overall 1-year fair-poor documented tissue fibrosis, arm edema, and decreased range of motion rates were 13%, 23%, and 27% for patients receiving MRM; 25%, 0%, and 50% for patients who underwent TSM; and 13%, 0%, and 0% for those undergoing BCS, respectively. Overall survival and disease-free survival were not statistically different between the groups. Conclusions These data suggest that breast conservation therapy may be considered a reasonable local treatment option for male patients presenting with breast cancer because it may offer functional advantages over mastectomy with comparable rates of local control and disease-free survival and overall survival. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of the study was to compare disease-free survival and overall survival in a group of matched males and females with breast cancer, and to analyze possible treatment- and gender-related differences. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 150 operable male breast cancer patients treated in our hospital from December 1980 to June 2012. Each male breast cancer patient recorded in the database was matched with two female breast cancer patients of equal stage. Prognosis in terms of disease-free survival and overall survival was evaluated. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 58.6±9.7 years for males and 57.2±10.3 years for females. The median follow-up was 69 months for males and 81 months for females. Significant differences were identified for tumor location, hormone receptor status, molecular subtypes and hormone therapy between the two groups. Monofactorial analysis demonstrated that tumor size, lymph node state, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, molecular subtypes and adjuvant chemotherapy treatment were prognostic factors in male breast cancer patients. The 5- and 10-year disease-free survival rates were 65.6 and 40.1% for males, and 74.9 and 51.5% for females, respectively. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 72.9 and 53.9% for males, and 83.2 and 68.5% for females, respectively. There was significantly difference in disease-free survival and overall survival between the two matched groups (P = 0.002). Conclusions: Male breast cancer patients had inferior outcome despite of equal stage in comparison with matched female breast cancer patients, which demonstrates that biological differences may contribute to the worse prognosis. ©The Author 2013.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is poorly understood with a large proportion arising in the familial context particularly with the BRCA2 germline mutation. As phenotypic and genotypic differences between sporadic and familial male breast cancers have been noted, we investigated the importance of a hypoxic drive in these cancers as this pathway has been shown to be of importance in familial female breast cancer. Expression of two major hypoxiainduced proteins, the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1A) and the carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), examined within a large cohort including 61 familial (3 BRCA1, 28 BRCA2, 30 BRCAX) and 225 sporadic male breast cancers showed that 31% of all male breast cancers expressed either HIF1A (25%) and/or CA9 (8%) in the combined cohort. Expression of HIF1A correlated with an increased incidence of a second-major malignancy (P=0.04), histological tumor type (P=0.005) and basal phenotype (P=0.02). Expression of CA9 correlated with age (P=0.004) in sporadic cases and an increased tumor size (P=0.003). Expression of HIF1A was prognostic for disease-specific survival in sporadic male breast cancers (HR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5-9.8, P=0.006) but not within familial male breast cancer, whereas CA9 was only prognostic in familial male breast cancers (HR: 358.0, 95% CI: 9.3-13781.7, P=0.002) and not in sporadic male breast cancer. This study found that hypoxic drive is less prevalent in male breast cancer compared with female breast cancer, possibly due to a different breast microenvironment. The prognostic impact of HIF1A is greatest in sporadic male breast cancers with an alternate dominant mechanism for the oncogenic drivers suggested in high risk familial male breast cancers. © 2014 USCAP, Inc.

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer accounts for less than 1% of all cancer in men and only around 1% of all diagnosed breast cancer. Despite a significant raise in the last 25 years, it still remains a rare disease. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study from 2004-2011 with 21 male breast cancer patients. We aimed to analyze the epidemiologic data (age, personal and family history), tumor characteristics (size, histological type, location, TNM stage, receptors), surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and survival (relapse, follow up, death) who reffered to our center with breast cancer. Results: The median age was 49.2±14.2 years (range 30-83 years). A family history of breast cancer was noted in four cases. The main clinical complaint was a retroareolar mass in 85.7%of patients (n=18). Histologically, 85.7% (n=18)were invasive ductal carcinoma and 4.7% (n=1) had ductal carcinoma in situ and 9.4% (n=2) had mixed histology including invasive medullary and ductal carcinoma. Hormonal therapy was delivered to 16 cases (76.1%) due to ER or PR positivity. During median follow up of 30 months (3-84 month), distant metastases were evident in 4 cases (19%). During the follow-up period, only one patient died due to metastatic disease. The mean time to recurrence detection was 30 months. Conclusions: The percentage of cases of male breast cancer is very low compared to breast cancer in females, explaining why very few investigations have been conducted in Iran. Limited coverage in the literature make gender-specific findings difficult so future research of this entity involving multi-institutional cooperation and longer follow up is essential to provide new insights about the biological and clinical factors of this rare cancer.},

	abstract = {Objective: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease entity and few data are available for the Chinese population. This study aimed to report MBC data from a single institution in Hong Kong to supplement existing evidence of this disease in our local population. Methods: Patients with histologically confirmed MBC treated between July 1997 and February 2012 were retrospectively identified from an institutional patient database. Clinical, pathological, treatment, and survival data were collected and subsequently analysed. Results: Within the captioned period, 52 cases of MBC were identified. The median age was 63 years, with evenly distributed tumour laterality. The majority of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma (84.6%), most of which were histologically grade II (50.0%). Almost all patients demonstrated hormone receptor positivity (oestrogen receptor-positive 98.0%, progesterone receptor-positive 96.0%), and HER2 amplification rate was 25.0%. Patients tended to present at an early stage of disease: approximately 85% presented as a T1 or T2 tumour, and 56.1 % had axillary nodal involvement. Surgery with curative intent was performed in 48 patients, with 13 (27.1 %) received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 35 (72.9%) underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. Almost all hormone receptor-positive patients received adjuvant tamoxifen. The median time to tamoxifen discontinuation was 60 months (range, 2-61 months). Discontinuation rate before 60 months was 15.9%. For those who underwent radical surgery, none developed loco-regional recurrence, and 5- and 10-year disease-free survival was 89.6% and 85.1%, respectively. The median overall survival for the entire population was 14.3 years. Conclusion: Our single-institutional data indicate that a good long-term survival outcome can be achieved in MBC following a treatment protocol similar to that established for females with breast cancer. Prospective data will be helpfid to further evaluate optimal treatment strategies as well as treatment tolerance for MBC in the Asian population. © 2015 Hong Kong College of Radiologists.},

	abstract = {Background: The goal of this population-based study was to determine the impact of post-mastectomy radiation therapy on long-term overall survival (OS) of male patients with breast cancer. Patients and Methods: We investigated 20-year OS rates of 664 patients diagnosed with primary stage I-III breast cancer in former East Germany between 1970 and 1989. Patients had a radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection without systemic adjuvant therapy. Results: Median follow-up time was 26.2 years (range 19-38 years). 52.4% of the patients had post-mastectomy radiotherapy. Radiotherapy showed different effects in each stage group after 20 years. Whereas there was an OS trend for radiotherapy to harm patients with stage I disease (hazard ratio (HR) 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-2.15; p = 0.065), radiotherapy showed no benefit in patients with stage II disease (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.62-1.1; p = 0.15). There was a significant survival benefit for patients with stage III disease receiving radiotherapy (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.41-0.88; p = 0.008). Conclusion: Post-mastectomy radiotherapy is associated with longer OS in male patients with stage III breast cancer. Male breast cancer patients at stages I and II do not seem to benefit from radiotherapy, but obsolete irradiation techniques might explain adverse long-term effects in earlier stages. © 2013 S.

	abstract = {Given that male breast cancer is a rare entity we analyzed a total of 99 consecutive cases of male breast cancer matched with 198 women. The aim was to better understand prognosis of the male compared to the female breast cancer. We found that men with breast cancer had a poorer DFS and OS when compared with women. Background: Breast cancer occurs rarely in men, accounting for approximately 1% of all breast carcinomas. Data on prognosis principally derive from retrospective studies and from extrapolation of female breast cancer series. Patients and Methods: A total of 99 men with invasive breast cancer were matched with 198 women with breast cancer who had surgery at the same institution from 1999 to 2010. Matching variables were year of surgery, age, primary tumor size, nodal involvement, hormone receptor status, status of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [ERBB2]), Ki-67, and grade. Median follow-up was 8.6 years. Results: Disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly poorer in the men (10-year DFS, 51.7% vs. 66.5%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.79; 95% CI, 1.19-2.68; P = .004). Similar results were observed for overall survival (OS) (10-year OS, 70.7% vs. 84.2%; HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.01-3.15; P = .043). The cumulative incidence of death for causes not related to the primary breast cancer was significantly higher for men than for women (HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.58-5.22; P = .001), whereas the breast cancerespecific survival (BCSS) was similar between the 2 groups (10-year BCSS, 81.5% vs. 88%; HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.62-2.59; P = .517). Conclusion: This comparative series found that men with breast cancer had a poorer DFS and OS when compared with women. The men also had a higher risk of contralateral tumors and second primaries. Appropriate counseling, surveillance, and prevention are recommended to improve survival for these individuals. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is a member of the CCN family of secreted proteins that are believed to play an important role in the development of neoplasia. In particular, CTGF has been reported to play an important role in mammary tumorigenesis and to have prognostic value in female breast cancer (FBC). The aim of the present study was to investigate clinicopathologic correlations and prognostic value of CTGF in male breast cancer (MBC) and to compare these findings with FBC. For this, we studied CTGF protein expression by immunohistochemistry in 109 MBC cases and 75 FBC cases. In MBC, stromal CTGF expression was seen in the majority of the cases 78% (85/109) with high expression in 31/109 cases (28.4%), but expression in tumor cells was only seen in 9.2% (10/109) of cases. High stromal CTGF expression correlated with high grade and high proliferation index (>15%) assessed by MIB-1 immunohistochemical staining. CTGF expression in tumor epithelial cells did not correlate with any of the clinicopathologic features. In FBC, stromal CTGF expression positively correlated with mitotic count and tumor CTGF expression was associated with triple negative status of the tumor (p = 0.002). Neither stromal nor tumor epithelial cell CTGF expression had prognostic value in MBC and FBC. In conclusion, stromal CTGF expression was seen in a high percentage of MBC and was correlated with high grade and high proliferation index. In view of the important role of the microenvironment in cancer progression, this might suggest that stromal CTGF could be an interesting target for novel therapies and molecular imaging. However, the lack of association with prognosis warrants caution. The potential role of CTGF as a therapeutic target for triple negative FBC deserves to be further studied. © 2015 Lacle et al.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare condition. Aromatase inhibitors are widely used for treating metastatic male breast cancer patients. In this setting, their use is not substantiated by prospective clinical trials, but is rather driven by similarities supposedly existing with breast cancer in postmenopausal women. This oversimplified approach was questioned by studies addressing the molecular and endocrine roots of the disease. In this manuscript, we discuss relevant aspects of the current use of aromatase inhibitors in metastatic male breast cancer in light of the most updated evidence on the molecular landscape of the disease and the specific changes in the hormonal background occurring with aging. We further point to strategies for blocking multiple hormonal pathway nodes with the goal of improving their therapeutic potential. We searched PubMed from its inception until March 2014 for relevant literature on the use of aromatase inhibitors in metastatic male breast cancer. Selected terms were combined and used both as medical headings and text words. The reference list of the suitable manuscripts was inspected for further publications. Aromatase inhibitors represent the mainstay of treatment in the metastatic setting. Yet, efforts aimed at sharpening the therapeutic potential of aromatase inhibitors still pose a challenge due to the paucity of data. The choice of dual hormonal (or sequential) therapy combining aromatase inhibitors with a GnRH analogue may represent a valid alterative, particularly if informed by cancer- and patient-related features including molecular, endocrine, and clinic characteristics. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Background:Data regarding the safety and effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as monotherapy or combined with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue in male breast cancer are scarce. Methods: In this retrospective chart review, cases of male breast cancer patients treated with AIs with or without a GnRH analogue were evaluated. Results: Twenty-three men were included into this case series. Aromatase inhibitors in combination with or without a GnRH analogue were given as first-line therapy in 60.9% and as second-line therapy in 39.1% of patients, respectively. All patients had visceral metastases, whereas in five of them bone lesions coexisted. In all cases AIs were tolerated well, and no case of grade 3 and 4 adverse events was reported. A partial response was observed in 26.1% of patients and stable disease in 56.5%. Median overall survival (OS) was 39 months and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13 months. Regarding OS and PFS, no significant effects of GnRH analogue co-administration or type of AI were noted.Conclusion:Our study shows that AIs with or without GnRH analogues may represent an effective and safe treatment option for hormone-receptor positive, pretreated, metastatic, male breast cancer patients. © 2013 Cancer Research UK.

	abstract = {Background:In cultured, dividing transformed T lymphocytes and in dividing bone marrow cells from normal men and those with a haematological malignancy, sex chromosome aneuploidy has been found to increase in prevalence and degree with age. This has rarely been investigated in non-dividing uncultured blood samples. The loss and gain of the X chromosome in dividing transformed lymphocytes in women with age is much more frequent than that of the Y chromosome in males. However, paradoxically X chromosome aneuploidy is rarely seen in the dividing cells of bone marrow of females.Methods:In blood samples from 565 men with breast cancer and 54 control men from the England and Wales general population, 80 cell nuclei per sample were scored for presence of X and Y chromosomes using fluorescent centromeric probes.Results:Sex chromosome aneuploidy, largely Y chromosome loss, was present in 63% of cases and 57% of controls, with the prevalence and degree of aneuploidy increasingly sharply and highly significantly with age. At ages 65-80 years, 71% of cases and 85% of controls showed aneuploidy and 15% and 25%, respectively, had ≥10% of cells aneuploid. Allowing for age, aneuploidy was less prevalent (P=0.03) in cases than controls.Conclusion:Sex chromosome aneuploidy in non-dividing nuclei of peripheral blood cells is frequent in adult men, the prevalence and degree increasing sharply with age. The possible relation of sex chromosome aneuploidy to breast cancer risk in men, and to cancer risk generally, needs further investigation, ideally in cohort studies. © 2013 Cancer Research UK.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is rare and few cases of breast cancer in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- infected patients are reported. We describe the case of breast cancer in a 65-year-old HIV-positive man who presented a nodule near the nipple of his left breast. He did not report risk factors for breast cancer, but he had liver cirrhosis. Biopsy of the lesion revealed a ductal carcinoma and he was submitted to mastectomy and axillary dissection. Staging resulted in pT1c/pN1a/M0; it was positive for the presence of oestrogen/progesterone receptors, negative for the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2. He was also treated with local radiotherapy and tamoxifen. At cancer diagnosis, he received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with undetectable HIV viral load, and his CD4+ T-cell count was 445 cells/mm3. Patients with HIV infection have a higher cancer risk due to immunosuppression: it concerns not only malignancies related to human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but also other cancers. A heightened awareness of male breast cancer by HIV specialists is needed, especially for particular risk categories, such as trans-sexuals who take oestrogen therapies, and for the presence of breast conditions, such as gynecomastia, usually considered as part of the lipodystrophy syndrome.},

	abstract = {Background Little is known regarding population-based disparities in male breast cancer (MBC). We analyzed this for Florida using data from 1996 to 2007. Materials and Methods Data from the Florida Cancer Data System, the Agency for Health Care Administration, and the US Census were linked for MBC patients (n = 1589). Survival time was our primary end point, with adjustments for sociodemographic status, neighborhood-based poverty measures, clinical and hospital characteristics, and comorbidity measures based on linkage with in- and outpatient treatment records. Survival time was modeled using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Results Five-year overall survival was 65.7%. Overall mean survival time in years was 7.7, but shorter in black (5.9) than white (7.8) individuals, in non-Hispanic (7.7) than Hispanic (8.5) individuals, and in the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) group (5.9) than in the highest (8.2) SES group. Patients with low SES also presented at a more advanced stage with only 75/175 [42.9%] of low SES patients who presented with localized disease compared with 311/621 [50.1%] for middle-high SES and 162/334 [48.5%] for the highest SES. Univariate hazard regressions found only the highest (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.85) and middle-high (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.94) SES were at improved survival compared with lowest SES but this advantage did not remain significant in the fully adjusted model. Marital status, age, smoking status, stage, treatments, and comorbidities were also predictors of survival. Conclusion Survival disparities among SES groups were most apparent in our study. Improved access to screening and health care utilization might attenuate these differences. Understanding other survival disparities can aid in public health and clinical care choices. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: With recent progress in health science administration, a huge amount of data has been collected from thousands of subjects. Statistical and computational techniques are very necessary to understand such data and to make valid scientific conclusions. The purpose of this paper was to develop a statistical probability model and to predict future survival times for male breast cancer patients who were diagnosed in the USA during 1973-2009. Materials and Methods: A random sample of 500 male patients was selected from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The survival times for the male patients were used to derive the statistical probability model. To measure the goodness of fit tests, the model building criterions: Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and Deviance Information Criteria (DIC) were employed. A novel Bayesian method was used to derive the posterior density function for the parameters and the predictive inference for future survival times from the exponentiated Weibull model, assuming that the observed breast cancer survival data follow such type of model. The Markov chain Monte Carlo method was used to determine the inference for the parameters. Results: The summary results of certain demographic and socio-economic variables are reported. It was found that the exponentiated Weibull model fits the male survival data. Statistical inferences of the posterior parameters are presented. Mean predictive survival times, 95% predictive intervals, predictive skewness and kurtosis were obtained. Conclusions: The findings will hopefully be useful in treatment planning, healthcare resource allocation, and may motivate future research on breast cancer related survival issues.},

	abstract = {The incidence of male breast cancer (MBC) is rising. Current treatment regimens for MBC are extrapolated from female breast cancer (FBC), based on the assumption that FBC prognostic features and therapeutic targets can be extrapolated to MBC. However, there is yet little evidence that prognostic features that have been developed and established in FBC are applicable to MBC as well. In a recent study on FBC, a combination of mitotic index and Bcl2 expression proved to be of strong prognostic value. Previous papers on Bcl2 expression in MBC were equivocal, and the prognostic value of Bcl2 combined with mitotic index has not been studied in MBC. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the prognostic value of Bcl2 in combination with mitotic index in MBC. Immunohistochemical staining for Bcl2 was performed on tissue microarrays of a total of 151 male breast cancer cases. Mitotic index was scored. The prognostic value of Bcl2 expression and Bcl2/mitotic index combinations was evaluated studying their correlations with clinicopathologic features and their prediction of survival. The vast majority of MBC (94%) showed Bcl2 expression, more frequently than previously described for FBC. Bcl2 expression had no significant associations with clinicopathologic features such as tumor size, mitotic count and grade. In univariate survival analysis, Bcl2 had no prognostic value, and showed no additional prognostic value to tumor size and histological grade in Cox regression. In addition, the Bcl2/mitotic index combination as opposed to FBC did not predict survival in MBC. In conclusion, Bcl2 expression is common in MBC, but is not associated with major clinicopathologic features and, in contrast to FBC, does not seem to have prognostic value, also when combined with mitotic index. © 2013 Lacle et al.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare disease treated as hormone receptor-positive female breast cancer. The characterization of breast cancer at the molecular level has lately revealed gender-related differences. As the androgen receptor is emerging as a potential oncogenic driver in male breast cancer, we analyzed efficacy data from metastatic patients treated with antiandrogens. We evaluated the activity of cyproterone acetate, either as a monotherapy or combined with a GnRH analog, in 36 metastatic male breast cancer patients. Fourteen patients were treated with cyproterone acetate as monotherapy and 22 patients with complete androgen blockade. We recorded 4 complete responses and 15 partial responses, for an overall response rate of 52.8 % (95 % CI, 36.5–69.4). Stable disease was reported in 11 patients. Median PFS was 8.9 months (95 % CI, 6.1–11.7), and median OS was 24.3 months (95 % CI, 22.5–26.1). Data on androgen receptor expression were available for 7 patients. All the 4 patients with androgen receptor-expressing tumors had a clinical benefit, including a patient with an estrogen receptor-negative disease. Conversely, none of the 3 patients with androgen receptor-negative tumors had a tumor response. Antiandrogen-based therapy showed efficacy in metastatic male breast cancer patients. Our results encourage considering antiandrogens in the therapeutic continuum, especially if supported by androgen receptor expression. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Here we describe clinicopathological features and genomic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status in a large cohort of familial MBCs. Methods: Cases (n=60) included 3 BRCA1 and 25 BRCA2 mutation carries, and 32 non-BRCA1/2 (BRCAX) carriers with strong family histories of breast cancer. The cohort was examined with respect to mutation status, clinicopathological parameters including TNM staging, grade, histological subtype and intrinsic phenotype.Results: Compared to the general population, MBC incidence was higher in all subgroups. In contrast to female breast cancer (FBC) there was greater representation of BRCA2 tumours (41.7% vs 8.3%, p=0.0008) and underrepresentation of BRCA1 tumours (5.0% vs 14.4%, p=0.0001). There was no correlation between mutation status and age of onset, disease specific survival (DSS) or other clincopathological factors. Comparison with sporadic MBC studies showed similar clinicopathological features. Prognostic variables affecting DSS included primary tumour size (p=0.003, HR:4.26 95%CI 1.63-11.11), age (p=0.002, HR:4.09 95%CI 1.65-10.12), lymphovascular (p=0.019, HR:3.25 95%CI 1.21-8.74) and perineural invasion (p=0.027, HR:2.82 95%CI 1.13-7.06). Unlike familial FBC, the histological subtypes seen in familial MBC were more similar to those seen in sporadic MBC with 46 (76.7%) pure invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC-NST), 2 (3.3%) invasive lobular carcinomas and 4 (6.7%) invasive papillary carcinoma. A further 8 (13.3%) IDC-NST had foci of micropapillary differentiation, with a strong trend for co-occurrence in BRCA2 carriers (p=0.058). Most tumours were of the luminal phenotype (89.7%), with infrequent HER2 (8.6%) and basal (1.7%) phenotype tumours seen.Conclusion: MBC in BRCA1/2 carriers and BRCAX families is different to females. Unlike FBC, a clear BRCA1 phenotype is not seen but a possible BRCA2 phenotype of micropapillary histological subtype is suggested. Comparison with sporadic MBCs shows this to be a high-risk population making further recruitment and investigation of this cohort of value in further understanding these uncommon tumours. © 2012 Deb et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1, BRCA2, and CHEK2 are known risk factors for female breast cancer. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 also are associated with male breast cancer (MBC). Similarly, it had been suggested in the original CHEK2 identification report that the CHEK2 1100delC mutation confers an increased risk for MBC. Here, we have evaluated the risk of CHEK2 1100delC for MBC by genotyping CHEK2 1100delC in 23 familial and 71 unselected Dutch MBC cases. None of the 23 familial MBC cases carried the CHEK2 1100delC mutation. In contrast, CHEK2 1100delC was present in 3 of the 71 (4.2%) unselected MBC cases, which was significantly more prevalent than the 1.1% Dutch population frequency assessed in 1,692 individuals (P = 0.05, OR = 4.1, 95% CI 1.2-14.3). Our data suggest that, in the Netherlands, CHEK2 1100delC is associated with an increased risk for MBC. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Gene amplification is an important mechanism for oncogene activation, a crucial step in carcinogenesis. Compared to female breast cancer, little is known on the genetic makeup of male breast cancer, because large series are lacking. Copy number changes of 21 breast cancer related genes were studied in 110 male breast cancers using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. A ratio of >1.3 was regarded indicative for gene copy number gain and a ratio >2.0 for gene amplification. Data were correlated with clinicopathological features, prognosis and 17 genes were compared with a group of female breast cancers. Gene copy number gain of CCND1, TRAF4, CDC6 and MTDH was seen in >40 % of the male breast cancer cases, with also frequent amplification. The number of genes with copy number gain and several single genes were associated with high grade, but only CCND1 amplification was an independent predictor of adverse survival in Cox regression (p = 0.015; hazard ratio 3.0). In unsupervised hierarchical clustering a distinctive group of male breast cancer with poor prognosis (p = 0.009; hazard ratio 3.4) was identified, characterized by frequent CCND1, MTDH, CDC6, ADAM9, TRAF4 and MYC copy number gain. Compared to female breast cancers, EGFR (p = 0.005) and CCND1 (p = 0.041) copy number gain was more often seen in male breast cancer, while copy number gain of EMSY (p = 0.004) and CPD (p = 0.001) and amplification in general was less frequent. In conclusion, several female breast cancer genes also seem to be important in male breast carcinogenesis. However, there are also clear differences in copy number changes between male and female breast cancers, pointing toward differences in carcinogenesis between male and female breast cancer and emphasizing the importance of identifying biomarkers and therapeutic agents based on research in male breast cancer. In addition CCND1 amplification seems to be an independent prognosticator in male breast cancer. © 2012 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess the impact of radiation management on male breast cancer (MBC) at London Regional Cancer Program (LRCP). Methods and Materials: Men with a diagnosis of breast cancer referred to LRCP were reviewed. The seventh American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system was used. Patients treated with and without post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) were analyzed. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as time duration from diagnosis to first recurrence. Overall survival (OS) was defined as time duration from pathologic diagnosis to death or last follow-up with any death defined as an event. Survival estimates were obtained using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Results: From January 1977 to December 2006, 81 men had invasive ductal carcinoma. The median age was 65 (range, 35-87 years). There were 15 Stage I, 40 Stage II, 20 Stage III, and 6 Stage IV patients. Median follow-up time was 46 months (range, 1-225 months). Of the 75 patients treated with curative intent, 29 did not receive PMRT and 46 completed PMRT. Patients who received PMRT demonstrated no benefit in overall survival (p = 0.872) but significantly better local recurrence free survival (p < 0.001) compared with those who did not receive RT. There was trend toward improving locoregional recurrence with PMRT in patients with high-risk features (node-positive, advanced stage, and ≤2 mm or unknown surgical margin). The median, 5-year, and 10-year disease-free survival and overall survival for the 75 patients were 77.7 months, 66.3%, 32.7%, and 91.2 months, 73.9%, and 36.6%, respectively. Conclusion: The experience at LRCP suggests that high-risk MBC patients should consider PMRT to improve their chance of local recurrence-free survival. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Fibrotic focus is a scar-like lesion near the center of a carcinoma and has been associated with high-grade, lymph node metastases and poor survival in female breast cancers. Hypoxia is suggested to be the crucial link between fibrotic focus and aggressive tumor phenotype and is also itself a poor prognostic marker. We here set out to study fibrotic focus and hypoxia in male breast cancer for the first time. In a group of 134 male breast cancer patients, the presence and size of a fibrotic focus and the expression of three hypoxia-related immunohistochemical stainings, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, carbonic anhydrase IX and Glut-1 were studied in correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Fibrotic focus was seen in 25% of the male breast cancer cases and was correlated with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α overexpression (P=0.023), high grade (P=0.005), high mitotic activity (P=0.005) and lymph node metastases (P=0.037). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-positive tumors were more often high grade (P=0.003) and HER2 amplified (P=0.005). Glut-1 expression was also more common in grade 3 tumors (P=0.038), but no association between carbonic anhydrase IX and any clinicopathological feature was found. Fibrotic focus >8 mm and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α overexpression were correlated with decreased patients outcome (P=0.035 and 0.008, respectively). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α overexpression was an independent and the most powerful predictor of survival in multivariate analysis (P=0.029; hazard ratio 2.5). In conclusion, the presence of a fibrotic focus is associated with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α overexpression, and both are associated with aggressive tumor phenotype and poor survival in male breast cancer. These markers seem to have similar clinical importance as previously reported in female breast cancer. © 2012 USCAP, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Systemic examinations revealed no evidence of malignant or occult primary lesion in the bilateral mammary glands or in other organs. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed for the locally advanced axillary tumor and reduced the tumor to 55 mm in size, and, then, he could undergo complete resection with a negative surgical margin in combination with reconstructive surgery to fill the resulting skin defect with a local flap of the latissimus dorsi muscle. The patient has presented with no metastatic lesion in four years since the operation.

	abstract = {Although rare, male breast cancer (MBC) remains a substantial cause for morbidity and mortality in men. Based on age frequency distribution, age-specific incidence rate pattern, and prognostic factor profiles, MBC is considered similar to postmenopausal breast cancer (BC). Compared with female BC (FBC), MBC cases are more often hormonal receptor (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor [ER/PR]) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative. Treatment of MBC patients follows the same indications as female postmenopausal with surgery, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy. To date, ER/PR and HER2 status provides baseline predictive information used in selecting optimal adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy and in the selection of therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease. HER2 represents a very interesting molecular target and a number of compounds (trastuzumab [Herceptin®; F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland] and lapatinib [Tykerb®, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK]) are currently under clinical evaluation. Particularly, trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody which selectively binds the extracellular domain of HER2, has become an important therapeutic agent for women with HER2-positive (HER2+) BC. Currently, data regarding the use of trastuzumab in MBC patients is limited and only few case reports exist. In all cases, MBC patients received trastuzumab concomitantly with other drugs and no severe toxicity above grade 3 was observed. However, MBC patients that would be candidate for trastuzumab therapy (ie, HER2+/ER+ or HER2+/ER- MBCs) represent only a very small percentage of MBC cases. This is noteworthy, when taking into account that trastuzumab is an important and expensive component of systemic BC therapy. Since there is no data supporting the fact that response to therapy is different for men or women, we concluded that systemic therapy in MBC should be considered on the same basis as for FBC. Particularly in male patients, trastuzumab should be considered exclusively for advanced disease or high-risk HER2+ early BCs. On the other hand, lapatinib (Tykerb), a novel oral dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets both HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor, may represent an interesting and promising therapeutic agent for trastuzumab-resistant MBC patients. © 2010 Ottini et al.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is extremely rare and poorly characterized on the molecular level. Using high-resolution genomic data, we aimed to characterize MBC by genomic imbalances and to compare it with female breast cancer (FBC), and further to investigate whether the genomic profiles hold any prognostic information. Fifty-six fresh frozen MBC tumors were analyzed using high-resolution tiling BAC arrays. Significant regions in common between cases were assessed using Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) analysis. A publicly available genomic data set of 359 FBC tumors was used for reference purposes. The data revealed a broad pattern of aberrations, confirming that MBC is a heterogeneous tumor type. Genomic gains were more common in MBC than in FBC and often involved whole chromosome arms, while losses of genomic material were less frequent. The most common aberrations were similar between the genders, but high-level amplifications were more common in FBC. We identified two genomic subgroups among MBCs; male-complex and male-simple. The male-complex subgroup displayed striking similarities with the previously reported luminal-complex FBC subgroup, while the male-simple subgroup seems to represent a new subgroup of breast cancer occurring only in men. There are many similarities between FBC and MBC with respect to genomic imbalances, but there are also distinct differences as revealed by high-resolution genomic profiling. MBC can be divided into two comprehensive genomic subgroups, which may be of prognostic value. The male-simple subgroup appears notably different from any genomic subgroup so far defined in FBC. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the molecular subtype profiles of male breast cancer (MBC) and subsequent clinical outcome using a validated 6-marker immunohistochemical panel. Methods: A total of 43 cases of MBC were examined retrospectively using a semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Ki-67, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2), epidermal growth factor receptor and cytokeratin 5/6. Patients were classified into the following categories: luminal A, luminal B, Her2-positive or basal-like subtypes. Results: The median age of patients was 63 years (r: 32-89). The predominant histology was invasive ductal carcinoma (91%). Only 1 patient had advanced breast cancer at diagnosis. Ninety-three percent were ER-positive and 84% were PR-positive. Two patients had tumors that were ER-and PR-negative. The distribution of tumor molecular subtypes was 19 (44%) luminal A, 22 (51%) luminal B and 2 (5%) basal-like. The Her2-positive tumor subtype was not identified. The clinicopathological characteristics did not differ significantly between tumor subtypes A and B. There were no significant differences in 6-year disease-free survival (74 vs. 82%, p = 0.77) or overall survival (74 vs. 82%, p = 0.69) between luminal A and luminal B subtypes, respectively. Conclusion: The most common subtypes in our cohort of MBC were luminal B followed by luminal A, and no differences were found between both tumor subtypes in terms of clinicopathologic characteristics and patient outcome.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease accounting for approximately 1% of all breast carcinomas. Presently treatment recommendations are derived from the standards for female breast cancer. However, those approaches might be inadequate because of distinct gender specific differences in tumor biology of breast cancer. This study was planned in order to contrast potential differences between female and male breast cancer in both tumor biological behavior and clinical management.Methods: MBC diagnosed between 1995-2007 (region Chemnitz/Zwickau, Saxony, Germany) was retrospectively analyzed. Tumor characteristics, treatment and follow-up of the patients were documented. In order to highlight potential differences each MBC was matched with a female counterpart (FBC) that showed accordance in at least eight tumor characteristics (year of diagnosis, age, tumor stage, nodal status, grade, estrogen- and progesterone receptors, HER2 status).Results: 108 male/female matched-pairs were available for survival analyses. In our study men and women with breast cancer had similar disease-free (DFS) and overall (OS) survival. The 5-years DFS was 53.4% (95% CI, range 54.1-66.3) in men respectively 62.6% (95% CI, 63.5-75.3) in women (p > 0.05). The 5-years OS was 71.4% (95% CI, 62.1-72.7%) and 70.3% (95% CI, 32.6-49.6) in women (p > 0.05). In males DFS analyses revealed progesterone receptor expression as the only prognostic relevant factor (p = 0.006). In multivariate analyses for OS both advanced tumor size (p = 0.01) and a lack of progesterone receptor expression were correlated (p = 0.01) with poor patients outcome in MBC.Conclusion: Our comparative study revealed no survival differences between male and female breast cancer patients and gives evidence that gender is no predictor for survival in breast cancer. This was shown despite of significant gender specific differences in terms of frequency and intensity of systemic therapy in favor to female breast cancer. © 2011 Foerster et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Metastases are present in nearly 60% of cases at the time of diagnosis with the lymph nodes, skeleton, lungs, brain and liver as the most frequent sites of metastases. Gastrointestinal involvement is rare, present in only 10% of all the cases. There is a very low risk of developing breast cancer in men. Case presentation. A 68-year-old man, with a past history of ductal breast cancer, presented with duodenal obstruction. Medical treatment was attempted without success, so he underwent surgery with subtotal gastrectomy and resection of the first portion of the duodenum. Histological examination showed a duodenal metastasis originating from the previous carcinoma of the breast. Five months after surgery, the patient is alive and well. Conclusion. Gastrointestinal metastases should be considered in patients with a past history of breast cancer. Surgical treatment should be performed in patients who are symptomatic and in good general condition. To our knowledge this is the only case of a gastrointestinal metastasis from breast carcinoma in a man. © 2009 licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Methods Using data from the national, population-based, 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, 66 cases of male breast cancer were identified (mean age = 66.2 years, mean time since diagnosis = 12.0 years). Male breast cancer cases were matched with 198 male BRFSS respondents with no history of cancer (control group) on age, education, and minority status. The male breast cancer and control groups were compared on physical and mental health status and health behaviors, using t-test and logistic regression analyses. Results The male breast cancer group reported poorer physical and mental health than controls. Male breast cancer survivors were significantly (p < 0.05) more likely to be obese (Odds Ratio = 2.41) and reported more physical comorbidities (Effect Size = 0.45) and activity limitations (Odds Ratio = 3.17), poorer life satisfaction (Effect Size = 0.41) and general health (Effect Size = 0.40), and more days in the past month when mental health (Effect Size = 0.49), and physical health (Effect Size = 0.29) were not good. In contrast, the male breast cancer and control groups were similar with regard to current health behaviors, including tobacco and alcohol use, diet, exercise, and health care. Conclusions The diagnosis and treatment of male breast cancer may be associated with clinically important and long-term deficits in physical and mental health status, deficits which may exceed those evidenced by long-term female breast cancer survivors.

	abstract = {Objective: This article reports on the findings of a qualitative study that explored the awareness and knowledge of male breast cancer among English-speaking men. The primary goal was to elicit information to guide both clinical practice and the development of gender-specific educational interventions. Methods: Interviews with 28 adult men, all of whom had no history of breast cancer themselves but had at least one maternal blood relative with the disease, were conducted and analyzed, using qualitative methods, to describe participants' awareness of male breast cancer, their knowledge of the disease, and how they thought awareness of male breast cancer could be increased in health care providers and the lay public. Results: Nearly 80% of participants weren't aware that men can get breast cancer; and although all were at higher risk given their positive family history, all reported that their providers had never discussed the disease with them. A majority couldn't identify any symptoms other than a lump in the breast. About 43% voiced concerns that a diagnosis of breast cancer would cause them to question their masculinity. Participants also suggested ways that men, as well as providers and the lay public, could be better made aware of and educated about their risk for this disease. Conclusion: This study provides much-needed insight into men's awareness and knowledge of male breast cancer. While further research with larger samples is needed, these findings offer a starting point for the development of evidence-based, gender-specific, health promotion and disease prevention interventions for men.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare disease. The aim of this study was to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in a group of matched males and females with breast cancer. The clinical data and survival status of 42 operable male breast cancer (MBC) cases treated at the Central Hospital of Tai'an from 1982 to 2006 were collected. Each MBC patient recorded in the database was matched with two female breast cancer (FBC) patients. Matching was conducted based on age, year of diagnosis, stage and pathology. SPSS 16.0 software was used for statistical analysis. The Chis-quare test was used for the categorical data, the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to analyze survival and the log-rank test was used to compare curves between the groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. The 42 MBC patients were matched with 84 FBC patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 58.0±11.3 years for males and 57.1±10.6 years for females, and the median follow-up time was 64 months (range, 5-262 months) for males and 71 months (range, 29-283 months) for females. Significant differences were identified for tumor location, hormone receptor status, adjuvant chemotherapy and hormone therapy between the two groups. Monofactorial analysis demonstrated that tumor size, lymph node status and AJCC stage were prognostic factors in MBC patients. The 5- and 10-year DFS rates were 61.2 and 40.7% for males, and 68.7 and 43.0% for females, respectively. The 5- and 10-year OS rates were 75.3 and 52.3% for males, and 82.9 and 63.2% for females, respectively. In our study, male breast carcinoma patients had a worse prognosis compared to female breast carcinoma patients which may be due to the deficiency of adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy.},

Data of 20,673 patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer (male: n = 84) who completed a questionnaire after discharge from hospital were analysed. HRQoL (SF-36), age, sex, education, native language, insurance status, and partnership status were measured. Cancer staging, treatment (partial mastectomy vs. radical mastectomy), and cancer site were indicated by the clinicians. The HRQoL scores of male breast cancer patients were compared with reference populations. Differences in HRQoL scores between men and women were compared using t tests and regression analysis. Compared to female breast cancer patients, male patients scored significantly higher on seven of eight subscales (physical functioning, role functioning=physical and emotional, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, and mental health) in the regression analysis. Compared to the reference populations (general male population, men aged 61-70, and the cancer-affected population), male breast cancer patients scored lower on SF-36 subscales on average, with major differences in emotional and physical role functioning. The results suggest that male breast cancer patients may need early interventions that specifically target role functioning, which is severely impaired compared to the male reference population. Future research needs to assess HRQoL with cancer-specific questionnaires and longitudinal designs also focussing on male patients in breast centres. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics, therapy methods, and prognosis of male breast cancer. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics, recurrence or metastasis, and survival information of 87 male breast cancer patients. Statistical analysis included the Kaplan-Meier method to analyze survivals, log-rank to compare curves between groups, and Cox regression for multivariate prognostic analysis. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: 5-year disease free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) were 66.3 and 77.0%, respectively. Monofactorial analysis showed tumor size, stage, lymph node involvement, and adjuvant chemotherapy to be prognostic factors with regard to 5-year DFS and 5-year OS. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed tumor size, stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy to be independent prognostic factors with regard to 5-year DFS and 5-year OS. Conclusion: Male breast cancer has a lower incidence rate and poor prognosis. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the main pathologic type. Operation-based combined therapy is the standard care for these patients. Tumor size, stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy are independent prognostic factors. More emphasis should be placed on early diagnosis and early therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy may improve survival. © 2011 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg.},

We retrospectively reviewed cases of male breast cancer treated with radiotherapy at Stanford University Medical Center with an emphasis on 22 patients treated with surgery and locoregional radiotherapy. We report trends in the surgical techniques as well as in the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. There were no isolated locoregional failures in this cohort, and 5-year disease-free survival was 65%. The use of contemporary surgical and radiotherapeutic techniques in men is discussed. We conclude that treatment guidelines designed for women should be applied to the locoregional management of breast cancer in men.

A 78-year-old man was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (T4d N3 M1, stage IV). He had advanced breast cancer consisting of multiple tumors with skin involvement and redness over the entire left chest region. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed a metastatic tumor in the left lung. Histologically, both the primary breast cancer and the metastatic lung tumor were identified as invasive ductal carcinoma that was estrogen receptor-negative (ER)(-) and progesterone receptor-negative (PgR)(-), with a HER2 score of 3+ (IHC). The patient received a combination chemotherapy using trastuzumab and paclitaxel. Two months later, a follow-up chest CT scan showed that the left lung tumor had disappeared, suggesting a good response to trastuzumab and paclitaxel. During trastuzumab treatment, no severe adverse events above grade 3 were observed. This is the first reported case of advanced HER2-positive male breast cancer in which a good response to trastuzumab and paclitaxel was demonstrated at both primary breast cancer and metastatic sites. © 2008 The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Aims: Male breast cancer is a rare disease, and knowledge of carcinogenesis is limited. Conflicting results, based on small series, have been reported for clinically relevant biomarkers. Methods and results: One hundred and thirty-four cases of male breast cancer were immunohistochemically stained on tissue microarrays for oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), BRST2, cyclinD1, bcl-2, p53, p16, p21, Ki67, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, CK14, and epidermal growth factor receptor. Data were correlated with clinicopathological features and patient outcome. High mitotic count and high grade were correlated with high Ki67, HER2 amplification/overexpression, p53 accumulation, high p21 expression, low PR expression, and low bcl-2 expression. PR negativity (P=0.009) and p53 accumulation (P=0.042) were correlated with decreased 5-year survival and were independent markers for patient outcome in Cox regression. In unsupervised hierarchical clustering, four groups were identified that were correlated with distinctive clinicopathological features. The hormone negative/ER-positive/high-grade cluster was significantly associated with decreased survival (P=0.011) and was an independent prognostic factor in Cox regression. Conclusions: Several tissue biomarkers are associated with an aggressive phenotype in male breast cancer. PR and p53 are the most promising individual prognostic markers. On the basis of immunophenotype, four distinctive and prognostically relevant male breast cancer groups were identified, indicating that protein expression profiling may be clinically useful in male breast cancer. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon disease with a frequency of approximately one in 1000. Due to the rarity of MBC, it is understudied and its etiology is poorly understood. Our objectives are to determine the frequency of pathogenic mutations in BRCA2 and PALB2 in MBC cases and to investigate the correlations between mutation status and cancer phenotypes. Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, direct sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were employed to screen for mutations in the BRCA2 gene, followed by direct sequencing of the PALB2 gene in BRCA2-negative MBC cases. Pathogenic BRCA2 mutations were identified in 18 of the 115 MBC cases, including four of the ten cases (40%) from breast cancer families and 14 of the 105 cases (13%) unselected for family history of breast cancer. The difference in BRCA2-mutation frequencies between cases with and without family history of breast cancer was not statistically significant (P = 0.145), suggesting that family history is not a strong predictor of carrying a mutation in males. We observed a highly significant association of carrying a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation with high tumor grade (P<0.001) and a weak association with positive lymph nodes (P < 0.02). Of the 97 BRCA2-negative MBC cases, we identified one PALB2 mutation with confirmed pathogenicity and one mutation predicted to be pathogenic, a prevalence of pathogenic PALB2-mutation of 1-2%. Based on our results and previous studies, genetic testing for BRCA2 should be recommended for any diagnosed MBC case, regardless of family history of breast cancer. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2010.},

	abstract = {Synchronous bilateral breast cancer is extremely rare in men and has not, up to date, been reported in Korea. A 54-year-old man presented with a palpable mass in the right breast. The right nipple was retracted and bilateral axillary accessory breasts and nipples were present. On physical examination, a 2 cm-sized mass was palpated directly under the right nipple, and, with squeezing, bloody discharge developed in a single duct of the left nipple. There was no palpable mass in the left breast, and axillary lymph nodes were not palpable. Physical examination of external genitalia revealed a unilateral undescended testis on the left side. Synchronous bilateral breast cancer was diagnosed using mammography, ultrasonography, and core-needle biopsy. Histopathological examination revealed invasive ductal carcinoma in the right breast and ductal carcinoma in situ in the left breast. Bilateral total mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and excision of accessory breasts in the axilla were performed. © 2012 Korean Breast Cancer Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Male breast cancer is a rare disease of largely unknown aetiology. In addition to genetic and hormone-related risk factors, a large number of environmental chemicals are suspected of playing a role in breast cancer. The identification of occupations or occupational exposures associated with an increased incidence of breast cancer in men may help to identify mammary carcinogens in the environment. Methods: Occupational risk factors for male breast cancer were investigated in a multi-centre case-control study conducted in eight European countries which included 104 cases and 1901 controls. Lifetime work history was obtained during in-person interviews. Occupational exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (alkylphenolic compounds, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins) were assessed on a case-by-case basis using expert judgement. Results: Male breast cancer incidence was particularly increased in motor vehicle mechanics (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.4) with a dose-effect relationship with duration of employment. It was also increased in paper makers and painters, forestry and logging workers, health and social workers, and furniture manufacture workers. The OR for exposure to alkylphenolic compounds above the median was 3.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 9.5). This association persisted after adjustment for occupational exposures to other environmental oestrogens. Conclusion: These findings suggest that some environmental chemicals are possible mammary carcinogens. Petrol, organic petroleum solvents or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are suspect because of the consistent elevated risk of male breast cancer observed in motor vehicle mechanics. Endocrine disruptors such as alkylphenolic compounds may play a role in breast cancer.},

Hence, this study aims to review the data from our local experience in order to better delineate the disease characteristics in our population. Materials and Methods: Male patients with histologically proven breast cancer were identifi ed from a prospectively collected database. The clinical, histopathological and survival data were reviewed retrospectively and analysed. Results: Twenty-one patients were identifi ed. The median age at diagnosis was 68 years. Eighteen patients underwent simple mastectomy with curative intent, with the remaining patients having metastatic disease at presentation. Almost half of the patients presented with stage III or IV disease. At the time of analysis, median overall survival was 50 months and median disease-free survival was 47.5 months. None of the patients had any documented family history or risk factors for male breast cancer. Conclusion: The disease appears to be a sporadic and rare occurrence in the local male population. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in males presented with a unilateral breast lump so that appropriate treatment can be instituted.},

	abstract = {Purpose Most male breast cancer tumours are hormone receptor- positive; the patients therefore receive endocrine therapy. There is, however, a paucity of published data on toxicities experienced by male breast cancer patients who are prescribed endocrine therapy. In the present study, we examined rates of adherence to and toxicity from endocrine treatments in male breast cancer patients treated at a single institution. Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective study of male patients diagnosed with breast cancer at The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre during 1981-2003. Data collected included patient age, hormone receptor status, therapy adherence, self-reported toxicities, and type and duration of endocrine therapies. Results The review located 59 cases of early-stage and metastatic male breast cancer. Median patient age was 68.0 years. Tamoxifen was given to 38 patients (64.4%), anastrozole to 8 (13.6%), and letrozole to 5 (8.5%). Of patients who received endocrine therapy, 10 (25%) received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Toxicity was reported by 19 patients taking tamoxifen (50%), with hot flashes being the most common complaint (18.4%). Decreased libido, weight gain, and malaise were reported by 5 patients (13.2%). Rash and erectile dysfunction were reported by 3 patients (7.9%). Increased liver enzymes, pulmonary embolism, superficial thrombophlebitis, myalgia, depression, visual blurring, and loose stools were each reported in 1 patient (2.6%). Tamoxifen therapy was discontinued secondary to toxicity in 9 patients (23.7%). Of the patients treated with anastrozole, 3 (37.5%) reported toxicity, with 1 report each of decreased libido, leg swelling, and depression (12.5%). Toxicity was reported in 2 patients taking letrozole (40%), with both reporting peripheral edema, and 1 reporting hot flashes. No patient discontinued anastrozole or letrozole because of toxicity. Conclusions Few studies specifically report data on adherence to and toxicities from endocrine therapies in male breast cancer patients. The rate of discontinuation at our institution because of toxicity (23.7%) is similar to that reported in the female breast cancer population. Future prospective studies should explore strategies to improve adherence to endocrine therapy in this population. © 2010 Multimed Inc.},

	abstract = {Background Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and little is known about its etiopathogenesis. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) provides a method to quantitatively measure the changes of DNA copy number and to map them directly onto the complete linear genome sequences. The aim of this study was to investigate DNA imbalances by aCGH and compare them with a female breast cancer dataset. Methods We used Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray Kit 44B and 44 K to compare genomic alterations in 25 male breast cancer tissues studied at NCC of Bari and 16 female breast cancer deposited with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE 12659). Data analysis was performed with Nexus Copy Number 5.0 software. Results All the 25 male and 16 female breast cancer samples displayed some chromosomal instability (110,93 alterations per patient in female, 69 in male). However, male samples presented a lower frequency of genetic alterations both in terms of loss and gains. Conclusion aCGH is an effective tool for analysis of cytogenetic aberrations in MBC, which involves different biological processes than female. Male most significant altered regions contained genes involved in cell communication, cell division and immunological response, while female cell-cell junction maintenance, regulation of transcription and neuron development. © The Author(s) 2011.},

Although aetiology is still unclear, constitutional, environmental, hormonal (abnormalities in estrogen/androgen balance) and genetic (positive family history, Klinefelter syndrome, mutations in BRCA1 and specially BRCA2) risk factors are already known. Clinic manifestation is painless hard and fixed nodule in the subareolar region in 75% of cases, with nipple commitment earlier than in women. Breast cancer has similar prognostic factors in males and females, among which axillary adenopathy (present in 40-55% cases) is the most important one. Although mammography, ultrasonography and scintigraphy can be useful tools in diagnosis; clinical assessment, along with a confirmatory biopsy, remains the main step in the evaluation of men with breast lesions. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma is the most frequent histological type. The established standard of care is modified radical mastectomy followed by tamoxifen for endocrine-responsive positive disease, although other options are being explored. While similarities between breast cancer in males and females exist, it is not appropriate to extrapolate data from female disease to the treatment of male.

Although its etiology is still unclear, constitutional, environmental, hormonal (abnormalities in estrogen/androgen balance) and genetic (positive family history, Klinefelter syndrome, mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2) risk factors are already known. One potential target is the vitamin D receptor (VDR). We have investigated whether polymorphisms in the VDR gene are associated with altered MBC risk in a Turkish population. Methods: We recruited 25 men with known breast cancer and 96 men selected from blood donations. Polymorphic sites in VDR gene ApaI (rs7975232), TaqI (rs731236) and FokI (rs10735810) were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Results: The unconditional logistic regression analysis demonstrated no significant association for the VDR ApaI (p=0.70), TaqI polymorphism (p=0.88) and FokI polymorphism (p=0.075). Conclusion: Our results do not support potential effects of VDR polymorphisms on MBC risk and possible differential effects of receptor status of the tumor. However, further studies focusing on the influence of polymorphisms and haplotypes on VDR functionality, activity and concentration are needed. © 2011 Zerbinis Medical Publications.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a poorly characterized disease because of its rarity. Clinical management is based on results obtained from randomized trials conducted in women notwithstanding data in the literature suggesting relevant gender-associated differences in terms of biological and clinical behavior. However, a genome-wide characterization of MBC on a transcriptional level is lacking. In this study, gene expression profiles of 37 estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MBC specimens were compared to that of 53 ER+ Female Breast Cancer (FBC) samples similar for clinical and patho-biological features. Almost 1000 genes were found differentially expressed (FDR < 1%) between female and male patients and biological interpretation highlighted a gender-associated modulation of key biological processes ranging from energy metabolism to regulation of translation and matrix remodeling as well as immune system recruitment. Moreover, an analysis of genes correlated to steroid receptors and ERBB2 suggested a prominent role for the androgen receptor in MBC with a minor relevance for progesterone receptor and ERBB2, although, similarly to FBC, a genomic amplification could be observed. Our findings support the idea that breast cancer is a quite different disease in male and female patients and the underlying gender-related biological differences are likely to have clinical implications connected with different susceptibility to treatment. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease with no standard treatment compared to female breast cancer. There are very few reports that go beyond second-line chemotherapy and endocrine therapy for advanced and recurrent MBC. Case Report: This report presents a case of recurrent MBC accompanied by carcinomatous pleuritis that responded to combination therapy with high-dose toremifene (TOR) and docetaxel (DOC). A 63-year-old male patient had previously undergone a modified radical mastectomy for left breast cancer and received several series of systemic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. He complained of severe dyspnea, and was admitted to our hospital due to a massive left pleural effusion caused by carcinomatous pleuritis. He received combination therapy with high-dose TOR and biweekly DOC. The pleural effusion disappeared without any severe side effects after 4 cycles of the therapy. Thereafter, his disease stabilized for 1 year without re-increase of tumor markers under continuous treatment with the combination therapy. Conclusions: High-dose TOR and DOC might be effective even beyond second-line chemotherapy and endocrine therapy for MBC to overcome potential multiple drug resistance and diminish inevitable side effects. © 2010 S.

Most data on male breast cancer comes from small single-institution studies, and because of the paucity of data, the optimal treatment for male breast cancer is not known. This article summarizes a multidisciplinary international meeting on male breast cancer, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health Office of Rare Diseases and the National Cancer Institute Divisions of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. The meeting included representatives from the fields of epidemiology, genetics, pathology and molecular biology, health services research, and clinical oncology and the advocacy community, with a comprehensive review of the data. Presentations focused on highlighting differences and similarities between breast cancer in males and females. To enhance our understanding of male breast cancer, international consortia are necessary. Therefore, the Breast International Group and North American Breast Cancer Group have joined efforts to develop an International Male Breast Cancer Program and to pool epidemiologic data, clinical information, and tumor specimens. This international collaboration will also facilitate the future planning of clinical trials that can address essential questions in the treatment of male breast cancer. © 2010 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Background: We report our findings on a hospital-based retrospective pilot cohort with casecontrols study, which we carried out to examine genetic, environmental, and occupational risk factors in men with breast cancer. Methods: 86 men with breast cancer were diagnosed in eight VA medical centers that agreed to collaborate on this project. A case-control analysis was conducted on a subset of the male breast cancer cases (n = 44) and age- and ethnicitymatched controls (n = 77). We compared host characteristics, comorbidities, and medications intake between cases and controls by using Chi-square analysis and Fisher's exact test. Results: The descriptive analysis showed that the majority of veterans with male breast cancer were non-Hispanic white (60%), older than 65 years at diagnosis (56%), and more likely estrogen receptor positive (45%). World War II veterans represented the largest group (22%), followed by the Vietnam era veterans (10%). Thirty-three percent reported a positive family history of cancer, while 18% had another primary cancer diagnosis. Prior alcohol (43%) and tobacco use (56%) was substantial among these patients. Twenty percent of patients were overweight or obese and 55% had comorbid diseases with heart disease being the most prevalent, followed by diabetes mellitus. The case-control analysis yielded a significantly greater proportion of cases with gynecomastia (p < 0.0001), a positive family history of cancer (p = 0.0028), history of antibiotic use (p = 0.0112), and history of tobacco use (p = 0.0143) compared to controls. Conclusion: The findings of this hospital-based pilot study indicate case-control differences in gynecomastia and family history of cancer. The pilot study lacked sufficient power to determine a true association between the variables of interest and warrants a large-scale collaborative study between the VA medical centers. © 2010 by Begell House, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: The role of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and their impact on estradiol (E2) levels remain unknown in male breast cancer (MBC) patients. Patients and methods: MBC patients with metastatic disease and those treated with AIs were selected from the breast cancer database of the Centre Antoine-Lacassagne (Nice, France). Sex hormone levels were retrospectively assessed on serum samples from our institutional serum bank. Results: Fifteen patients entered the study. Two patients (13%) had complete response, four patients (27%) had partial response, two patients (13%) had stable disease and seven patients (47%) had progressive disease. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 4.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-8.6] and 33 months (95% CI 18.4-47.6), respectively. All assessable patients (n = 6) had E2 levels less than the lower limit of the assay during AI treatment. Among them, three had partial response, one had stable disease and two had progressive disease. A large increase in follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and E2 levels was observed in one responding patient at progression. Conclusions: AIs are active in MBC patients. This activity is correlated with a significant reduction in E2 levels. Secondary resistance is in part related to a deleterious feedback loop resulting in a significant increase in substrate for aromatization. © The Author 2009.

	abstract = {Male Breast Cancer (MBC) is a rare disease in the U.S., accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancers. Rates of MBC in Africa are more variable than in the U.S., therefore, understanding the risk factors involved in a population like Egypt can clarify the nature of MBC. The polyglutamine tract (QT) is a variable region of the androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear receptor which is important in modulating androgen actions and generally inhibits growth in breast tissue. It is hypothesized that a long QT results in weaker AR activity over the lifetime, resulting in less AR mediated control over cellular division and higher risk of MBC. As a corollary, we expect to see a distribution skewed toward longer QTs in MBC patients compared to controls and overall relatively longer QT's in populations with higher rates of MBC. This study aimed to investigate for the first time the distribution of AR QT lengths among MBC patients in Egypt. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 44 Egyptian MBC patients were analyzed for this polymorphism. Amplification followed by fragment length analysis revealed QT length. For the control series, blood from 43 Egyptian males without a family or personal history of breast or prostate cancers was collected and analyzed similarly. There was no significant difference between patients and controls with respect to mean QT length (P = 0.84; means were 19.5 ± 2.8 and 19.3 ± 4.2, for patients and controls, respectively). Though, short QT lengths were more prevalent among controls (14.0%), but almost absent in cases (2.3%). Although the mean lengths were not different in cases and controls, the near absence of short tracts in cases suggests a possible protective effect of very short QT lengths against MBC.

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease representing less than 1% of all malignancies in men and only 1% of all incident breast cancers. Our study details clinico-pathological features, treatments and prognostic factors in a large Moroccan cohort. Findings. One hundred and twenty-seven patients were collected from 1985 to 2007 at the National Institute of Oncology in Rabat, Morocco. Median age was 62 years and median time for consultation 28 months. The main clinical complaint was a mass beneath the areola in 93, 5% of the cases. Most patients have an advanced disease. Ninety-one percent of tumors were ductal carcinomas. Management consisted especially of radical mastectomy; followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and hormonal therapy with or without chemotherapy. The median of follow-up was 30 months. The evolution has been characterized by local recurrence; in twenty two cases (17% of all patients). Metastasis occurred in 41 cases (32% of all patients). The site of metastasis was the bone in twenty cases; lung in twelve cases; liver in seven case; liver and skin in one case and pleura and skin in one case. Conclusion: Male breast cancer has many similarities to breast cancer in women, but there are distinct features that should be appreciated. Future research for better understanding of this disease at national or international level are needed to improve the management and prognosis of male patients. © 2011 Bourhafour et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare and inadequately characterized disease. The aim of the present study was to characterize MBC tumors transcriptionally, to classify them into comprehensive subgroups, and to compare them with female breast cancer (FBC).Methods: A total of 66 clinicopathologically well-annotated fresh frozen MBC tumors were analyzed using Illumina Human HT-12 bead arrays, and a tissue microarray with 220 MBC tumors was constructed for validation using immunohistochemistry. Two external gene expression datasets were used for comparison purposes: 37 MBCs and 359 FBCs.Results: Using an unsupervised approach, we classified the MBC tumors into two subgroups, luminal M1 and luminal M2, respectively, with differences in tumor biological features and outcome, and which differed from the intrinsic subgroups described in FBC. The two subgroups were recapitulated in the external MBC dataset. Luminal M2 tumors were characterized by high expression of immune response genes and genes associated with estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. Luminal M1 tumors, on the other hand, despite being ER positive by immunohistochemistry showed a lower correlation to genes associated with ER signaling and displayed a more aggressive phenotype and worse prognosis. Validation of two of the most differentially expressed genes, class 1 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and the metabolizing gene N-acetyltransferase-1 (NAT1), respectively, revealed significantly better survival associated with high expression of both markers (HLA, hazard ratio (HR) 3.6, P = 0.002; NAT1, HR 2.5, P = 0.033). Importantly, NAT1 remained significant in a multivariate analysis (HR 2.8, P = 0.040) and may thus be a novel prognostic marker in MBC.Conclusions: We have detected two unique and stable subgroups of MBC with differences in tumor biological features and outcome. They differ from the widely acknowledged intrinsic subgroups of FBC. As such, they may constitute two novel subgroups of breast cancer, occurring exclusively in men, and which may consequently require novel treatment approaches. Finally, we identified NAT1 as a possible prognostic biomarker for MBC, as suggested by NAT1 positivity corresponding to better outcome. © 2012 Johansson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background. Male breast cancer accounts for less than 1% of all breast cancers, yet males have a worse prognosis than females with breast cancer. Methods. Using the 1988-2003 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program data, we conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study to investigate stage-specific differences in breast cancer-specific and allcause mortality between males and females. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox regression models to compare breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality by stage between males and females, controlling for potential confounding variables. Results. There were 246,059 patients with a first, single, primary breast cancer [1,541 (0.6%) male; 244,518 (99.4%) female]. Compared with females, males were more likely to be older, Black, married, diagnosed at more advanced stages, and treated with mastectomy (each P<0.001). Males also were more likely to have lower grade and estrogen/progesterone receptor-positive tumors (each P<0.001). After controlling for confounders, males were more likely to die from their breast cancer when compared with females, only if diagnosed with stage I disease (aHR 1.72, CI 1.15-2.61). For all-cause mortality, males were more likely than females to die at each stage of disease except stage IV. Conclusions. Although all-cause mortality was higher for men than women at all stages of nonmetastatic breast cancer, higher male breast cancer-specific mortality was attributed to poorer survival in stage I disease. However, this statistical difference is unlikely to be clinically relevant and attributable to in-stage migration. © Society of Surgical Oncology 2010.},

	abstract = {Background: The discovery of small non-coding RNAs and the subsequent analysis of microRNA expression patterns in human cancer specimens have provided completely new insights into cancer biology. Genetic and epigenetic data indicate oncogenic or tumor suppressor function of these pleiotropic regulators. Therefore, many studies analyzed the expression and function of microRNA in human breast cancer, the most frequent malignancy in females. However, nothing is known so far about microRNA expression in male breast cancer, accounting for approximately 1% of all breast cancer cases.Methods: The expression of 319 microRNAs was analyzed in 9 primary human male breast tumors and in epithelial cells from 15 male gynecomastia specimens using fluorescence-labeled bead technology. For identification of differentially expressed microRNAs data were analyzed by cluster analysis and selected statistical methods.Expression levels were validated for the most up- or down-regulated microRNAs in this training cohort using real-time PCR methodology as well as in an independent test cohort comprising 12 cases of human male breast cancer.Results: Unsupervised cluster analysis separated very well male breast cancer samples and control specimens according to their microRNA expression pattern indicating cancer-specific alterations of microRNA expression in human male breast cancer. miR-21, miR519d, miR-183, miR-197, and miR-493-5p were identified as most prominently up-regulated, miR-145 and miR-497 as most prominently down-regulated in male breast cancer.Conclusions: Male breast cancer displays several differentially expressed microRNAs. Not all of them are shared with breast cancer biopsies from female patients indicating male breast cancer specific alterations of microRNA expression. © 2010 Lehmann et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {The etiology of male breast cancer is largely unknown, reflecting its relative rarity. Although a number of previous studies have suggested relationships with a variety of medical conditions, the results have largely derived from case-control studies and may reflect recall biases. Within the large U.S. Veterans Affairs computerized medical care system database, we had the opportunity to access 26 million hospital discharge records over the period 1969-1996 and to relate various documented medical conditions to the risk of subsequent male breast cancer. This allowed us to calculate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for male breast cancer associated with conditions occurring one or more years after initial hospitalization, adjusted for age, race, calendar year, duration of follow-up, and number of hospital visits. Among 4,501,578 men aged 18-100 years, a total of 642 cases of primary male breast cancer were identified (523 among whites, 119 among blacks). Medical conditions that were significantly related to risk were diabetes (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.60), obesity (1.98, 1.55-2.54), orchitis/epididymitis (1.84, 1.10-3.08), Klinefelter syndrome (29.64, 12.26-71.68), and gynecomastia (5.86, 3.74-9.17). Additionally, among black patients, cholelithiasis emerged as a significant risk predictor (3.45, 1.59-7.47). Diseases that have previously been related to male breast cancer risk that were not supported by our study results included thyroid diseases, smoking-related conditions, liver cirrhosis, prostatic hyperplasia, and fractures. After adjustment for obesity, the association with diabetes disappeared, but that with gynecomastia persisted. In multivariate models that simultaneously considered all important medical predictors of risk, significant risks were seen for Klinefelter syndrome (16.83, 6.81-41.62), gynecomastia (5.08, 3.21-8.03), obesity (1.91, 1.50-2.44), and orchitis/epididymitis (1.80, 1.08-3.01). These results support previous speculations that male breast cancer is influenced not only by tissue at risk, but also by hormonal and inflammatory factors. © 2009 US Government.},

	abstract = {Recently, the number of studies on male breast cancer (MBC) has been increasing. However, as MBC is a rare disease there are difficulties to undertake studies to identify specific MBC subgroups. At present, it is still largely unknown whether BRCA-related breast cancer (BC) in men may display specific characteristics as it is for BRCA-related BC in women. To investigate the clinical-pathologic features of MBC in association with BRCA mutations we established a collaborative Italian Multicenter Study on MBC with the aim to recruit a large series of MBCs. A total of 382 MBCs, including 50 BRCA carriers, were collected from ten Italian Investigation Centres covering the whole country. In MBC patients, BRCA2 mutations were associated with family history of breast/ovarian cancer (p < 0.0001), personal history of other cancers (p = 0.044) and contralateral BC (p = 0.001). BRCA2-associated MBCs presented with high tumor grade (p = 0.001), PR- (p = 0.026) and HER2+ (p = 0.001) status. In a multivariate logistic model BRCA2 mutations showed positive association with personal history of other cancers (OR 11.42, 95 % CI 1.79-73.08) and high tumor grade (OR 4.93, 95 % CI 1.02-23.88) and inverse association with PR+ status (OR 0.19, 95 % CI 0.04-0.92). Based on immunohistochemical (IHC) profile, four molecular subtypes of MBC were identified. Luminal A was the most common subtype (67.7 %), luminal B was observed in 26.5 % of the cases and HER2 positive and triple negative were represented by 2.1 % and 3.7 % of tumors, respectively. Intriguingly, we found that both luminal B and HER2 positive subtypes were associated with high tumor grade (p = 0.003 and 0.006, respectively) and with BRCA2 mutations (p = 0.016 and 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that BRCA2-related MBCs represent a subgroup of tumors with a peculiar phenotype characterized by aggressive behavior. The identification of a BRCA2-associated phenotype might define a subset of MBC patients eligible for personalized clinical management. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Because the disease is so rare, controlled clinical trials have almost never been performed and treatment is based on findings in women or small series of men. Similarly, while breast cancer in women is diagnosed at an increasingly early stage, male breast cancer is usually diagnosed late, when the chances of cure are diminished. This article reviews what is currently known about male breast cancer, with an emphasis on areas where evidence-based data are scarce. While it is possible that some recent developments in female breast cancer treatment could be applicable to men, but the way forward is to increase awareness of the disease, and for treatment centers to pool patients for inclusion in randomized clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the 15-year experience with breast cancer in males at a single institution. Methods: The data from 25 male patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer at a single center were retrospectively analysed. Their medical records were studied for clinical characteristics, therapeutic modalities used and factors associated with disease free (DFS) and overall survival (OS), like local recurrence/distant metastasis. Results: The median patient age was 67 years (range 38-83). The most frequent presenting symptom was a palpable lump. Eighteen (72%) patients underwent modified radical mastectomy (MRM), while sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed in 14 (56%) cases. Of 25 patients, 21 (84%) underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and 15 (71.4%) of them had pathological axillary lymph node involvement. Two of 25 (8%) patients with bone and liver metastases underwent toilet mastectomy due to breast ulceration. Estrogen receptor (ER) was positive in 15 (60%) patients, while progesterone receptor (PR) and C-erbB2 (HER-2) were positive in 10 (40%) and 2 (8%) patients, respectively. Ten patients (40%) had both ER(+) and PR(+). The median follow-up period was 19 months (range 3-102). Local recurrence developed in one (4%) patient and distant metastasis in 4 (16%). Five-year OS and DFS were 53 and 49%, respectively. In univariate and multivariate analysis, pathological tumor size (<2 vs. >2 cm), pathological lymph node involvement and preoperative skin involvement over the breast were not associated with breast recurrence. Only in univariate analysis local recurrence/distant metastasis were associated with poor OS. Conclusion: Large cooperative studies are needed using strict clinical and laboratory criteria to advance the understanding of this disease and to identify the most effective treatment approaches. © 2012 Zerbinis Medical Publications.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Epigenetic events are, along with genetic alteration, important in the development and progression of cancer. Promoter hypermethylation causes gene silencing and is thought to be an early event in carcinogenesis. The role of promoter hypermethylation in male breast cancer has not yet been studied. Methods: In a group of 108 male breast cancers, the methylation status of 25 genes was studied using methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Methylation of more than 15% was regarded indicative for promoter hypermethylation. Methylation status was correlated with clinicopathological features, with patients' outcome and with 28 female breast cancer cases. Results: Promoter hypermethylation of the genes MSH6, WT1, PAX5, CDH13, GATA5 and PAX6 was seen in more than 50% of the cases, but was uncommon or absent in normal male breast tissue. High overall methylation status was correlated with high grade (P = 0.003) and was an independent predictor of poor survival (P = 0.048; hazard ratio 2.5). ESR1 and GSTP1 hypermethylation were associated with high mitotic count (P = 0.037 and P = 0.002, respectively) and high grade (both P = 0.001). No correlation with survival was seen for individual genes. Compared with female breast cancers (logistic regression), promoter hypermethylation was less common in a variety of genes, particularly ESR1 (P = 0.005), BRCA1 (P = 0.010) and BRCA2 (P < 0.001). The most frequently hypermethylated genes (MSH6, CDH13, PAX5, PAX6 and WT1) were similar for male and female breast cancer. Conclusion: Promoter hypermethylation is common in male breast cancer and high methylation status correlates with aggressive phenotype and poor survival. ESR1 and GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation seem to be involved in development and/or progression of high-grade male breast cancer. Although female and male breast cancer share a set of commonly methylated genes, many of the studied genes are less frequently methylated in male breast cancer, pointing towards possible differences between male and female breast carcinogenesis. © 2012 Kornegoor et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Male breast cancer is a rare disease with an incidence rate less than 1% of that of female breast cancer. Given its low incidence, few studies have assessed risk and prognosis. Methods: This population-based study, including 459,846 women and 2,665 men diagnosed with breast cancer in Denmark, Finland, Geneva, Norway, Singapore, and Sweden over the last 40 years, compares trends in incidence, relative survival, and relative excess mortality between the sexes. Results: World standardized incidence rates of breast cancer were 66.7 per 10 5 person-years in women and 0.40 per 10 5 person-years in men. Women were diagnosed at a younger median age (61.7 years) than men (69.6 years). Male patients had a poorer 5-year relative survival ratio than women (0.72 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.75] v 0.78 [95% CI, 0.78 to 0.78], respectively), corresponding to a relative excess risk (RER) of 1.27 (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.42). However, after adjustment for age and year of diagnosis, stage, and treatment, male patients had a significantly better relative survival from breast cancer than female patients (RER, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97). Conclusion Male patients with breast cancer have later onset of disease and more advanced disease than female patients. Male patients with breast cancer have lower risk of death from breast cancer than comparable female patients. © 2011 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of adjuvant therapy on survival in males with non-metastatic breast cancer. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of male breast cancers treated between 1990 and 2003 was performed. Age, estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PgR) status, tumor histology and stage, and details of surgical and adjuvant therapy were recorded. Five and ten-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated using the actuarial Kaplan-Meier method with comparisons made using the log-rank test. Results: Forty-two men received treatment for nonmetastatic breast cancer; median age, 62 years (range, 24-90 years). All tumors were ER and PgR positive. Twenty-one received tamoxifen (50%), 18 chemotherapy (43%), and 11 radiation (26%). Median follow-up was 8 years (range, 3-18 years). Five and ten-year OS in patients who received tamoxifen and radiation was 100%, compared with 81% and 65%, respectively, with tamoxifen alone (P = .06), 92% and 83% radiation alone (P = .05), and 85% and 65% without adjuvant therapy (P = .03). Five- and 10-year DFS was 100% and 83.3% with tamoxifen and radiation, 90% and 70% with tamoxifen alone (P = .45), 50% and 50% with radiation alone (P = .05), and 80.8% and 67.9% without adjuvant therapy (P = .27). Adjuvant chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with Tamoxifen and/or radiation, did not significantly improve OS or DFS. Conclusion: This series suggests an important role for adjuvant tamoxifen and radiation in the management of ER- and PgR-positive nonmetastatic male breast cancer. Larger, multicenter datasets are warranted for this rare disease to validate these results.© 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This study examined male cases reported from 1988 through 2006 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute for differences in cancer stage, tumor size at diagnosis, and survival rate between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions. Pearson's chi-square was used to evaluate differences in stage and tumor size at diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess survival differences after adjusting for confounders (race, marital status, median family income, age, and education). Regional differences in tumor grade size and stage at diagnosis were not statistically significant; however, survival differences were observed between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions. An interaction between nonmetropolitan area and regional stage MBC was a significant predictor of poorer survival. Raising awareness of MBC in nonmetropolitan areas could save the lives of many men and action should be taken to improve health care access, treatment, and thus prognosis in this population. © The Author(s) 2011.},

Although the underlying causes are not well understood, certain populations are at higher risk, including certain gene mutation carriers, men with Klinefelter syndrome, and certain ethnic groups. Male breast cancer typically presents at a later stage than female breast cancer. A palpable mass is the most common presentation, but nipple discharge or other nipple changes may be seen. Because the number of affected individuals is small, prospective trials have not been conducted; thus, treatment recommendations are typically taken from large trials involving female breast cancer populations. Although outcomes in male breast cancer were previously thought to be worse than female breast cancer outcomes, it appears that they are similar. Questions regarding the most effective surgical and adjuvant therapies remain. Mastectomy with axillary lymph node evaluation, adjuvant hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy are commonly used. Providers of health care to male patients must be aware of the possibility of breast cancer and appropriately evaluate any suspicious changes. © 2012 WPMH GmbH.},

	abstract = {Aims: Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon disease with a paucity of information in the literature. The treatment of MBC has traditionally been extrapolated from experience with female breast cancer. This study reports on the treatment and outcomes of this disease in South Australia over a 30-year period. Methods: From 1977 to 2007 63 patients with a median age of 62years (range 33-85years) were identified and treated for MBC. Data obtained, included initial stage, pathological features, treatment and outcomes. Results: With a median follow up of 4.9years (range 2months to 19years) the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 85% with median survival of 5.5years. In all, 18 (29%) were diagnosed with recurrent disease, while 45 (72%) remained disease free. The median time to recurrence was 2.5years. One patient failed locally, three (4%) had locoregional recurrence and distant recurrence was noted in 14 patients (22%). Disease stage at presentation was a significant predictor of 5-year OS and recurrence (P=0.012 and P=0.0001). Tumor diameter was also a significant predictor of 5-year OS and recurrence (P=0.006 and P=0.021). Conclusion: This retrospective series has a 5-year OS that compares favorably with other published series of MBC. The positive findings may help change the misperception that MBC is an inherently aggressive disease process with a poor clinical outcome. Further studies are needed to carefully and thoroughly investigate this rare but treatable disease. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

	abstract = {Studies concerning adjuvant systemic therapy and prognosis in male breast carcinoma (MBC) are limited. We aimed to evaluate outcome of the changing practices of adjuvant systemic treatment and survival in operable MBC patients over the last two decades. The medical records of 148 MBC patients followed between the years 1986 and 2009 at 7 cancer center were evaluated retrospectively. One hundred and eighteen operable non-metastatic patients had sufficient data were included the study. One hundred and eighteen operable MBC were found to be eligible. Median age was 60 (range 29-83) years. Thirty-two percent of the patients had T3-4 tumors. Half of the patients had axillary lymph node-positive disease. The proportion of positivity of estrogen receptor(ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and HER2 status were 82.9, 75.8, and 23.4%, respectively. Only, 7 patients had triple negative (TN). Adjuvant hormonotherapy was advised for 76.8% whereas adjuvant chemotherapy for 73.7% of the patients. Median follow-up was 40.9 months (range 3.8-186 months). Locoregional and/or distant recurrence developed in thirty-eight patients (32.2%). Twenty-three patients died during the follow-up period. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was found to be 60%, whereas overall survival (OS) was 82%. Larger tumor size and lymph node positivity were statistically significant poor prognostic factors for OS. Although statistical insignificant, patients with HER2-positive tumors have worse DFS (52 vs. 120 months, log rank P = .73) and OS (85 vs. 144 months, log rank P = .30) than HER2-negative ones. Although the frequency of the use of adjuvant systemic therapy in MBC has been increasing and survival rates improving for the last decades, lymph node status and tumor size are still the most important determining factors for prognosis. There is a need for further prognostic information in men with HER2-positive or TN breast cancer. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

The purpose of this study is to report the first MaleBC series in Lebanon, describing its clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical phenotype, and how it compares with MaleBC in the West and with female breast cancer in Lebanon and the Middle East. Forty-seven cases of MaleBC were reviewed. Results showed younger ages at presentation (62 years versus 67 years), higher incidence of lobular carcinoma (6% versus 1%), and more frequent p53 positivity and axillary node metastases in our series than in those reported about MaleBC. Other results such as higher estrogen receptor (ER) positivity and lower HER-2/neu over-expression were comparable to the literature. These findings suggest that MaleBC in our region may represent a biologically different tumor with potentially distinct prognostic and therapeutic implications. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Objective: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease representing less than 1% of all malignancies. The objective of the study is to report clinicopathological characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes of MBC in Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt. Methods: This retrospective study focused on male breast cancer patients during 10 years (2000-2009). The studied variables were data regarding general characteristics of patients, treatment modalities and survival. Results: The series included 37 patients (0.8% of all breast cancer). The median age was 57.7 years (range: 26-86 years). The main clinical complaint was a mass beneath the areola in 94.5% of the cases. Most patients had a locally advanced disease. 94.5% of tumors were invasive duct carcinomas. The treatment was essentially surgery in 91.8%, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (in 89.2%), hormonal therapy (in 56.7%) and chemotherapy (in 91.8%). Follow-up period ranged from 6-115 months. Local recurrence occurred in 4 cases and metastasis in 11 cases. The 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 81.6% and 60.5%, respectively. The 2-year and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 68.4%, and 52.6%, respectively. OS was not significantly affected by any of the studied parameters. Factors influencing DFS were: T stage (P=0.05), positive lymph nodes (P=0.043), metastasis (P=0.004), and chemotherapy (P=0.046). Conclusions: MBC is a rare disease and often diagnosed at a locally advanced stage. The management of male and female breast carcinoma is identical. Future research for better understanding of this disease is needed to improve the management and prognosis of male breast cancer patients. © 2012 by Cancer Biology & Medicine.},

Aim of the study: The review of the latest information on epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment. Material and methods: Articles on breast cancer in men and study bibliographies. Results: Risk factors are related to high estrogen level, chest wall radiation and family history. BRCA1 mutations have been reported in men with breast cancer, although BRCA2 mutations are more frequent. Ductal carcinoma is the most common histological subtype of breast cancers. Breast cancer in males is more likely to express hormonal receptors and less likely to overexpress HER2 than in females. The most common symptom is a painless lump. Sentinel node biopsy has been coming into prominence. Local therapy is required for non-metastatic cancer. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and trastuzumab-therapy should be applied in men, if these methods of treatment would be found effective with women patients with the same diagnosis. Adjuvant hormonal therapy plays a very important role in male breast cancers with hormonal receptors expression. Conclusions: Breast cancer is similar in males and in females. Since there are differences in treatment response between men and women, the future studies should be focused on disease biology in men and new targeted therapy options. Copyright © 2011 Cornetis.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer accounts for around 1% of all breast cancer cases, but the incidence has increased over the past 25. years. The rarity of this entity precludes prospective randomized clinical trials. Although breast carcinoma in both genders share certain characteristics, notable differences have emerged. Familial cases usually have BRCA2 rather than BRCA1 mutations. Klinefelter syndrome is the strongest risk factor for developing male breast carcinoma. Men tend to be diagnosed at an older age than women. Presentation is usually a painless lump, but is often late, with more than 40% of individuals having stage III or IV disease. When survival is adjusted for age at diagnosis and stage of disease, outcomes for male and female patients with breast cancer is similar. Surgery is usually mastectomy with axillary clearance or sentinel node biopsy. Because 90% of tumors are hormonal receptor positive, tamoxifen is standard adjuvant therapy. Indications for radiotherapy and chemotherapy are similar to female breast cancer. For metastatic disease, hormonal therapy is the main treatment, but chemotherapy can also provide palliation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease. Rates of MBC in Northern Africa vary by region. The age-standardized incidence for MBC is higher in Morocco than in Egypt, and the Egyptian rate is similar to the U.S of approximately 1/105. This study aimed at investigating the clinical and molecular characteristics of MBC in Egypt and Morocco. Methods: This case-case study included 211 cases from Egypt and 132 from Morocco. Tumor tissues were available for 47 Egyptian and 18 Moroccan patients. Medical record information was abstracted for patients' demographics, medical history, and treatment. BRCA2 protein expression status was examined in Egyptian and Moroccan tumors. Androgen receptor CAG repeat length was analyzed using the tissue samples in Egyptian MBC tumors and controls. Limited amount of tissues from Morocco did not allow for the analysis of CAG repeats. Results: Egyptian MBC patients had a significantly lower age at diagnosis (Egypt: 57.5 ± 15.1, Morocco: 63.9 ± 14.4, P=0.0002) and a higher prevalence of liver cirrhosis (Egypt: 28.0%, Morocco: 0.8%, P=< 0.0001). MBC patients also had higher tumor grades [I (0.9%), II (81.0%), III (18.1%)] in Egypt vs. [I (10.7%), II (81.0%), III (8.3%)] in Morocco (P=0.0017). The clinical and molecular characteristics of the groups from the 2 countries did not significantly differ. There was no significant difference with respect to BRCA2 expression amongst countries (Egypt: 28.9% non-wild type, Morocco: 27.8% non-wild type, P=0.9297) or CAG lengths amongst BRCA2 expression types in Egyptians (Wild type: 54.6% with CAG repeat lengths of 20+, Non-wild type: 50% with CAG repeat lengths of 20+, P=0.7947). Conclusions: Differences in MBC between Egypt and Morocco are more likely due to differences in other risk factors such as consanguinity and use of xenoestrogenic pesticides. © 2011/2012-IOS Press and the authors.

	abstract = {Background. The purpose was to analyze the behavior of male breast cancer. Methods. Fifty-eight male breast cancer patients were treated at the HUCH during 19812006. Data on risk factors, tumor characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment and survival were obtained by chart review. Results. Presentation occurred at a median age of 63 years, most often due to a self-detected lump. The median size of the primary tumor was 1.8 cm and 14% were T4 tumors. Forty-seven percent had lymph node metastases and 4% distant metastases at diagnosis. Ductal carcinoma was the most common tumor type. All tumors with known receptor status were positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and 79% for progesterone receptor (PgR). Her-2 overexpression was found in 2/19 patients (11%). A family history of breast cancer, obesity, high alcohol intake and liver cirrhosis were the most often seen risk factors. Nineteen percent had one or two other malignancies, the most common second malignancy being prostate cancer in 7%. Ninety-seven percent were operated by mastectomy and 90% by axillary evacuation while sentinel node biopsy alone was done only in 7%. Sixty percent of the patients received radiotherapy, 64% adjuvant hormonal treatment, 20% adjuvant chemotherapy, and 2% adjuvant trastuzumab. Fourteen patients (25%) experienced a relapse of which 60% were distant, bone being the most common site. During follow-up 21 patients (37%) died, of whom nine of breast cancer and 12 due to other causes. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 75%. Conclusions. Male breast cancer behaves and is today treated in many respects like postmenopausal breast cancer. However, due to rudimentary breast tissue the symptoms, diagnosis and especially a higher amount of T4 tumors differ from that of females. Also the risk factor profile and histologic subgroups seem different. The 5-year OS of 75% is clearly higher than 44% reported at our institution in 1982. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.},

	abstract = {No study has evaluated the performance of BRCA1/2 mutations prediction models in male breast cancer (MBC) series. Although rare, MBC deserves attention because male and female breast cancers share many characteristics, including the involvement of genetic predisposition factors such as BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Indeed, the occurrence of MBC is a commonly used criterion to select families for BRCA mutation testing. We evaluated the performance and clinical effectiveness of four different predictive models in a population-based series of 102 Italian MBC patients characterized for BRCA1/2 mutations. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated for each risk model at the 10% threshold. The area under the ROC (AUC) curves and its corresponding asymptotic 95% CIs were calculated as a measure of the accuracy. In our study, the BRCAPRO version 5.0 had the highest combination of sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV for the combined probability and for the discrimination of BRCA2 mutations. In individuals with negative breast-ovarian cancer family history, BRCAPRO 5.0 reached a high discriminatory capacity (AUC=0.92) in predicting BRCA2 mutations and showed values of sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of 0.5, 0.98, 0.97 and 0.67, respectively, for the combined probability. BRCAPRO version 5.0 can be particularly useful in dealing with non-familial MBC, a circumstance that often represents a challenging situation in genetic counseling. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Although breast cancer in men is uncommon, its incidence rate has an increasing trend. Due to its low incidence, there are few studies in this subject and limited information is available. The purpose of this study was to investigate clinicopathological characteristics and survival of male breast cancer (MBC) in Fars Province, south of Iran. Methods: The data for this study were obtained from the population based cancer registry of Vice-Chancellor for Health Affairs of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and Shiraz hospitals between January 1, 1989 and January 1, 2008, including 64 patients with MBC. Demographic, clinical and pathological aspects were investigated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the determination of survival rate and Log Rank test for the comparison. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for the multiple analysis. Results: The patients' mean age at the time of diagnosis was 60.3 years (SD=12.7). The most frequent age group (26.6%) was 51-60 years. The most common symptom (96.8%) was a palpable mass. The majority of patients (44.4%) had a symptom duration of less than or equal to 6 months. 56.3% of the patients had a tumor size of 2-4.9 cm. Forty six percent of the cases had axillary lymph node involvement. The median survival time was 10.0 years [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.0-14.0]. The 5 year overall survival rate was 66.0% (95% CI=51.0-81.0%). The median survival time of patients with axillary lymph node involvement was 8.2 years (95% CI=6.7-9.6) and for the cases without involvement was 12.0 years (95% CI=8.4-15.2). In addition to axillary lymph node involvement, positive family history in contrast to negative family history and left tumors in comparison with right tumors were poorer prognostic factors in univariate analysis respectively (p=0.006, p=0.031). In multiple analysis, axillary lymph node involvement was an independent predictor of poorer survival (Hazard ratio=1.6, 95% CI=1.1-6.4, p=0.030) and the other variables did not have a significant effect. Conclusion: The mean age of MBC in this series is lower than that in western countries. It is compatible to the mean age of female breast cancer which is approximately one decade less than that in developed countries. The survival rate of MBC is relatively lower than that in western countries. Axillary lymph node involvement is an important prognostic factor in the survival of MBC. Multicenter population based studies with greater number of patients are required for better estimation of different aspects of MBC in Iran. © Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal.},

Material and methods: Four hundred and eighty-nine patients were collected from 1990 to 2005. Median age was 66 years (34% over 70 years) and median follow-up 58 months. Results: According to TN classification, we found T1: 39%, T2: 41%, T3T4: 9%, Tx: 11% and N1N2: 27%. Lumpectomy (L) and mastectomy (M) were performed in 8.6% and 91.4% of the cases. Axillary dissection (AD), sentinel node biopsy or both were performed in 90%, 2% and 5% of the cases, respectively. Ninety-five percent of tumours were ductal carcinomas; 47% were pT1, 20% pT2 and 33% pT3-T4. Axillary nodal involvement was present in 52.8% cases. ER and PgR were positive in 92% and 89% cases. Radiotherapy (RT) was performed in 85% of the patients. Hormonal treatment (HT) was delivered in 72% of the cases. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors were used in 85% and 12% of the cases; 34% of the patients received chemotherapy (CT). Local recurrence (LR), nodal recurrences (NR) and metastases occurred in 2%, 5% and 22% of the cases; 2% and 10% developed contralateral BC and second cancer. The 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 81% and 59%; disease-specific survivals (DSS) were 89% and 72%. Death causes were BC 56%, second cancer 8%, complications 3%, intercurrent disease 15% and unknown 18%. In a univariate analysis, metastatic risk factors were T stage (T1: 19%, T2: 26%, T3T4: 40%; p = 0.013), pN status (pN0: 12% pN1-3: 26% pN>3: 44%; p < 0.0001) and presence of locoregional recurrence (62% versus 18% p < 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis, axillary nodal involvement and high SBR remain prognostic factors. Conclusion: Earlier diagnosis and wide use of adjuvant treatments (RT/HT/CT) widely decreased LR and increased survival rates in MBC, reaching female ones. Prognostic factors were also very similar to female ones. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Male Breast Cancer (MBC) is very rare and accounts for less than one percent of all cancers in men. Because of the low incidence of MBC it has not attracted extensive studies. The current study is the first cohort of men with breast carcinoma reported in our country to date. Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 58 MBC patients who had been treated at Shahid Faghihi Hospital in Shiraz, Iran, between 1990 and 2007. Data regarding general characteristics of patients including: age at time of diagnosis, family history of breast cancer, site, stage, size and location of tumor, histopathology of primary tumor, and treatment modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and hormone therapy) were obtained by reviewing medical records. Results: Among 58 MBC patients included in current study, 98.3% of patients were presented with a palpable mass, while 22.4% had breast skin deformity, and 12.1% patients had breast discharge. The median age at time of diagnosis was 60 years (range, 34-84 years). Infiltrative ductal carcinoma was found in 96.2% of patients, insitu ductal carcinoma in 3.8% of patients. The histopathological diagnosis of 5 breast tumors was missed. 4.3% of tumors were diagnosed in stage 0, 10.6% in stage one, 74.5% in stage two, and 10.6% in stage three. Regional lymph node involvement were diagnosed in 20.7% of patients, and 15.5% patients had distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Conclusion: This study, in spite of limitations, suggests that the incidence of MBC is increasing, and men are diagnosed with later-stage disease than women. Therefore, MBC screening should become a part of female breast cancer registry system. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {It has been demonstrated that monoallelic PALB2 (Partner and Localizer of BRCA2) gene mutations predispose to familial breast cancer. Some of the families reported with germline PALB2 mutations presented male breast cancer as a characteristic clinical feature. Therefore, we wanted to investigate the contribution of germline PALB2 mutations in a set of 131 Spanish BRCA1/BRCA2-negative breast/ovarian cancer families with at least one male breast cancer case. The analysis included direct sequencing of all coding exons and intron/exon boundaries as well as a Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification-based analysis of genomic rearrangements. For the first time we have identified a genomic rearrangement of PALB2 gene involving a large deletion from exon 7 to 11 in a breast cancer family. We have also identified several PALB2 variants, but no other obvious deleterious PALB2 mutation has been found. Thus, our study does not support an enrichment of PALB2 germline mutations in the subset of breast cancer families with male breast cancer cases. The identification of intronic and exonic variants indicates the necessity of assessing the implications of variants that do not lead to PALB2 truncation in the pathoghenicity of the PALB2 gene. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Because of its rarity, male breast cancer is often compared with female breast cancer. Patients and Methods: To compare and contrast male and female breast cancers, we obtained case and population data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program for breast cancers diagnosed from 1973 through 2005. Standard descriptive epidemiology was supplemented with age-period-cohort models and breast cancer survival analyses. Results: Of all breast cancers, men with breast cancer make up less than 1%. Male compared with female breast cancers occurred later in life with higher stage, lower grade, and more estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Recent breast cancer incidence and mortality rates declined over time for men and women, but these trends were greater for women than for men. Comparing patients diagnosed from 1996 through 2005 versus 1976 through 1985, and adjusting for age, stage, and grade, cause-specific hazard rates for breast cancer death declined by 28% among men (P = .03) and by 42% among women (P ≈ 0). Conclusion: There were three intriguing results. Age-specific incidence patterns showed that the biology of male breast cancer resembled that of late-onset female breast cancer. Similar breast cancer incidence trends among men and women suggested that there are common breast cancer risk factors that affect both sexes, especially estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Finally, breast cancer mortality and survival rates have improved significantly over time for both male and female breast cancer, but progress for men has lagged behind that for women. © 2009 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Background Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare and scarcely investigated disease. The strongest genetic risk factor for MBC is represented by inherited BRCA2 mutations, whereas the association between MBC and BRCA1 mutations is less clear. MBC appears to be biologically similar to breast cancer in females, however the phenotypic haracteristics of BRCA1/2-related MBCs are not yet well elucidated. Objective To investigate the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of MBC in a large and wellcharacterized population-based series of 108 MBCs from Tuscany (Central Italy) and to evaluate associations between BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status and clinical-pathological features including breast/ovarian cancer first-degree family history, tumor histology and grade, proliferative activity, estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. Results BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations were identified in ten MBCs, in particular, two cases (1.9%) carried BRCA1 and eight cases (7.4%) carried BRCA2 mutations. The same BRCA1 mutation (3347delAG) was detected in two unrelated MBC cases. Three novel BRCA2 pathogenic mutations were found. Statistically significant associations emerged between BRCA2-related tumors and absence of PR expression (P = 0.008), HER2 over-expression (P = 0.002) and high tumor grade (P = 0.005). Conclusions Here, we (i) reported that in our population about 9% of MBC cases are accounted for by BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations; (ii) enlarged the BRCA2 mutational spectrum and (iii) characterized a specific phenotype associated with BRCA2-related MBCs suggestive of aggressive behavior. Overall, our results may have important implications on clinical management for this rare disease. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.},

	abstract = {Background: Cancer of the male breast accounts for about 1% of all malignancies in men and 1% of all breast cancers. Poor level of awareness often results in late presentation and delayed diagnosis in our environment. This study was done to analyse the demographic data, management and survival of male breast cancers in Indian subset of patients and compare it with that of western literature. Materials and Methods: A 10 year (2001-2010) retrospective study of all male breast cancers was done. Data regarding the incidence, presentation, histopathology, stage and grade of tumor, management and outcome of patients were analysed. Results: 26 cases of male breast cancer were encountered. This comprised 0.4% of all breast cancers seen in our department during the 10 year period. The ages of patients ranged from 45-75 years with a mean age of 57 years. Family history was present in 4 patients. Clinically, symptoms included self-detected lump in 23 (88.5%) patients, nipple retraction in 12 (46.1%) and pain in 12 (46.1%). All cases were unilateral (16 on right, 10 on left). Disease most commonly involved central quadrant (9 patients). Grade 3 disease was found in 13 patients and Stage 3 disease was most commonly encountered (13 patients). None of our patients received neo adjuvant chemotherapy. 20 (76.9%) patients had modified radical mastectomy and 6 (23.1%) had radical mastectomy. Most of our patients were hormone receptor positive (21 patients). Bilateral orchidectomy, Adjuvant chemotherapy, Adjuvant radiotherapy and Tamoxifen were offered in 3 (11.5%), 16 (61.5%), 17 (65.4%) and 15 (57.7%) patients respectively. Follow up ranged from 1-59 months. Conclusion: Male breast cancer is rare in our centre. Late presentation with advanced disease is a common feature in our environment. Further multiinstitutional, prospective studies are needed for better understanding of management of male breast cancers in Indian subset of patients.},

Material and methods: A 59 years old male patient was referred with diagnosis of intraocular tumor in right eye. Three years ago radical right-side mastectomy was performed (T2N1M0). The medical history revealed that the patient was under chemoand hormontherapy due to right breast cancer with lungs, liver and mediastinum metastases. Based on the ophthalmological examination the diagnosis of intraocular tumor was established - choroidal metastasis with exudative retinal detachment. Due to tumor size and general dissemination external beam irradiation of tumor was performed. Conclusions: The majority of choroidal metastases in males are secondary to lung carcinoma, however in differential diagnosis it is necessary to consider also rare cases of breast carcinoma metastases. Treatment strategy should be considered individual depending on size, localization, presence of metastases to other organs and general condition of the patient.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Male breast cancer (MBC) in China usually has been studied retrospectively with small sample size, and studies analyzing the prognostic factors are rare. This study was to investigate the prognostic factors of Chinese patients with MBC based on the data from a single institute with a relatively large sample. Methods: Clinical data of 72 patients with histopathologically confirmed MBC who received treatment at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between January 1969 and March 2009, were collected. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test and Cox regression model were used for statistical analysis. Results: The 5-year overall survival rate was 72.4%, and the survival rates for stage I, II, III, and IV were 100%, 74.2%, 57.2%, and 0%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the tumor size (P < 0.001), axillary lymph node status (P = 0.001), TNM stage (P = 0.001), operation model (with vs. without: P < 0.001; classic radical resection vs. modified radical resection, P = 0.336) and endocrine therapy(P = 0.02) significantly influenced the survival. Multivariate Cox regression showed that TNM stage (P = 0.035), operation model (P = 0.021) and endocrine therapy (P = 0.019) were independent prognostic factors for MBC. Conclusions: Early diagnosis and comprehensive treatment strategy consisting of surgery and endocrine treatment is essential to improve the survival of the patients with MBC, and TNM stage, operation and endocrine treatment are the significant prognostic factors for MBC.},

	abstract = {Retrospective review of presentation, treatment and outcome of male breast cancer in a tertiary cancer centre in eastern India. Data of 42 male breast cancer (MBC) patients, who presented between April, 2001 and March, 2008 were collected from institute records with respect to epidemiological characteristics, clinical and pathological parameters, treatment pattern and outcome. This series includes 42 patients with mean age of 56 years (range 31-78 years). MBC represented 1. 1 % of all breast cancer. History of lump in the breast with duration ranging from 1 month to 4 years was the most common clinical presentation (80. 95 %). Histopathology found infiltrating ductal carcinoma in 35 (83. 33 %), followed by papillary carcinoma in 3 (7. 14 %), undifferentiated carcinoma in 2 (4. 76 %), mucinous carcinoma in 1 (2. 38 %) and myxofibrosarcoma in 1 (2. 38 %) patient. Hormone receptor (HR) study was performed on 29 patients. Twenty six (89. 7 %) patients were hormone receptor positive in that 8 (27. 6 %) were ER positive and 18 (62. 1 %) were ER and PR positive. 3 (10. 3 %) were hormone receptor negative. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed on 30 patients. Of those, 60 % were found to be positive (pN+) and 40 % were negative (pN-). Of the patients with invasive carcinoma 2. 86 % were pathologic stage I, 37. 14 % stage II, 42. 86 % stage III and 17. 14 % stage IV. Of the 35 treated patients, total 30 (85. 71 %) patients underwent surgery. The surgery consisted of a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) 24 (80 %), radical mastectomy according to Halsted (RM) 6 (20 %). Adjuvant therapy i. e. Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy was administered to the patient based upon their stage. The standard treatment for all HR positive patients was administration of tamoxifen. Based upon the follow-up information (ranging from 17 month to 136 months), 4 (14. 28 %) patients developed local recurrence over 4 to 26 months (mean17. 5 months) and 5 patients developed distant metastasis over 24 to132 months (mean 78 months). Disease specific survival varied from 4 months to 132 months, with a mean of 56. 75 months. Thirteen out of 28 evaluable patients (46. 43 %) were disease free at 5 years. Male Breast cancer is a rare disease often ignored in the community, because of which it is seeks medical attention at advanced stage. Majority of MBC are found to be HR positive, hence hormonal therapy should to be strongly considered and multicentric prospective studies are needed to improve outcome. © 2012 Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) in men is rare compared with BC in women, but its incidence is increasing along with attention toward this uncommon disease. Although with some differences, male and female BC share similar genetic predisposition factors, including BRCA1/2, CHEK2, and PALB2 mutations. As other BRCA1/2 functionally related DNA repair genes, such as CHEK2 and PALB2, BRIP1 is considered a moderate-penetrance BC susceptibility gene. At present, the role of BRIP1 on BC susceptibility in men is unknown. In this study, we aimed to assess whether BRIP1 variants may contribute to male BC (MBC) risk, by screening 97 MBC cases, all negative for BRCA1/2, CHEK2, and PALB2 mutations, selected from a population-based series of 126 MBCs from Central Italy. A total of five BRIP1 germ-line sequence alterations, three coding, and two non-coding variants, were detected in our series. The two non-coding variants IVS4-28G > A and 3'UTR 4049C>T were classified as neutral by in silico analysis. Of the three coding variants, one was a silent variant (E879E) and two resulted in amino acid substitution (R264W and P919S) showing a putative pathogenic role by in silico analysis. However, further analysis of tumor-associated loss of heterozygosity and the frequency of variant alleles, tested in 203 male population controls, suggested a neutral effect for both of these variants. Overall, our results indicate that BRIP1 variants may not play a relevant role in MBC predisposition. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MaleBC) is a rare disease, accounting for <1% of all male tumors. During the last few years, there has been an increase in the incidence of this disease, along with the increase in female breast cancer (FBC). Little is known about the etiology of MaleBC: hormonal, environmental and genetic factors have been reported to be involved in its pathogenesis. Major risk factors include clinical disorders carrying hormonal imbalances, radiation exposure and, in particular, a positive family history (FH) for BC, the latter suggestive of genetic susceptibility. Rare mutations in high-penetrance genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) confer a high risk of BC development; low-penetrance gene mutations (i.e. CHEK-2) are more common but involve a lower risk increase. About 90% of all male breast tumors have proved to be invasive ductal carcinomas, expressing high levels of hormone receptors with evident therapeutic returns. The most common clinical sign of BC onset in men is a painless palpable retroareolar lump, which should be evaluated by means of mammography, ultrasonography and core biopsy or fine needle aspiration (FNA). To date, there are no published data from prospective randomized trials supporting a specific therapeutic approach in MaleBC. Tumor size together with the number of axillary nodes involved are the main prognostic factors and should guide the treatment choice. Locoregional approaches include surgery and radiotherapy (RT), depending upon the initial clinical presentation. When systemic treatment (adjuvant, neoadjuvant and metastatic) is delivered, the choice between hormonal and or chemotherapy (CT) should depend upon the clinical and biological features, according to the FBC management guidelines. However great caution is required because of high rates of age-related comorbidities. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Molecular subtyping of breast cancer by gene expression has proven its significance in females. Immunohistochemical surrogates have been used for this classification, because gene expression profiling is not yet routinely feasible. Male breast cancer is rare and large series are lacking. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry for molecular subtyping of male breast cancer. A total of 134 cases of male breast cancer were immunohistochemically stained on tissue microarrays for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as well as for CK5/6, CK14, and Ki67. HER2 was also assessed by chromogen in situ hybridization. Cases were classified as luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+, and HER2-and Ki67 low), luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, and HER2+ or Ki67 high), HER2 driven (ER-, PR-, HER2+), basal-like (ER-, PR-, HER2-, CK5/6+ and/or CK14+ and/or EGFR), or unclassifiable triple-negative (negative for all six markers). Luminal type A was by far the most encountered type of male breast cancers, representing 75% of the cases. Luminal type B was seen in 21% and the remaining 4% of cases were classified as basal-like (n=4) and unclassifiable triple-negative (n=1). No HER2 driven cases were identified. Patients with basal-like cancer were significantly younger (P=0.034). Luminal B type cancers showed significantly higher histological grade (P<0.001), mitotic index (P<0.001), and PR negativity (P=0.005) compared with luminal type A cancers. In conclusion, most male breast cancers are luminal A and luminal B types, whereas basal-like, unclassifiable triple-negative, and HER2 driven male breast cancers are rare. Luminal type B seem to represent a subtype with an aggressive phenotype. This distribution of molecular subtypes in male breast cancer is clearly different compared with female breast cancers, pointing to possible important differences in carcinogenesis. © 2012 USCAP, Inc.

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and little is known about its etiopathogenesis. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) provides a method to quantitatively measure the changes of DNA copy number and to map them directly onto the complete linear genome sequences. The aim of this study was to investigate DNA imbalances by aCGH and compare them with a female breast cancer dataset. Methods: We used Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray Kit 44B and 44K to compare genomic alterations in 25 male breast cancer tissues studied at NCC of Bari and 16 female breast cancer deposited with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE12659). Data analysis was performed with Nexus Copy Number 5.0 software. Results: All the 25 male and 16 female breast cancer samples displayed some chromosomal instability (110.93 alterations per patient in female, 69 in male). However, male samples presented a lower frequency of genetic alterations both in terms of loss and gains. Conclusion: aCGH is an effective tool for analysis of cytogenetic aberrations in MBC, which involves different biological processes than female. Male most significant altered regions contained genes involved in cell communication, cell division and immunological response, while female cell-cell junction maintenance, regulation of transcription and neuron development. © 2010 IOS Press and the authors.

	abstract = {National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for female breast cancer treatment and surveillance are well established, but similar guidelines on male breast cancers are less recognized. As an NCCN institution, our objective was to examine practice patterns and follow-up for male breast cancer compared to established guidelines for female patients. After Institutional Review Board approval, a prospective breast database from 1990 to 2009 was queried for male patients. Medical records were examined for clinico-pathological factors and follow-up. The 5-year survival rates with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and Greenwood formula. Of the 19,084 patients in the database, 73 (0.4%) were male patients; 62 had complete data. One patient had bilateral synchronous breast cancer. The median age was 68.8 years (range 29-85 years). The mean/median invasive tumor size was 2.2/1.6 cm (range 0.0-10.0 cm). All cases had mastectomy (29 with axillary node dissection, 23 with sentinel lymph node biopsy only, 11 with sentinel node biopsy followed by completion axillary dissection). Lymph node involvement occurred in 25/63 (39.7%). Based on NCCN guidelines, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiation are indicated in 34 cases, 62 cases, and 14 cases, respectively. Only 20/34 (59%) received chemotherapy, 51/62 (82%) received hormonal therapy, and 10/14 (71%) received post-mastectomy radiation. Median follow-up was 26.2 months (range: 1.6-230.9 months). The 5-year survival estimates for node positive and negative diseases were 68.5% and 87.5%, respectively (p = 0.3). Despite the rarity of male breast cancer, treatment options based on current female breast tumors produce comparable results to female breast cancer. Increased awareness and a national registry for patients could help improve outcomes and tailor treatment recommendations to the male variant. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is rare in men, accounting for approximately 1% of all cases of breast carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence, presentation, histopathological types, management and outcome of male patients with breast cancer treated at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria. METHODS: A 20 year (1987-2006) retrospective study of all male patients with breast cancer was done. Clinic demographic data regarding age, sex, clinical information, treatment and follow up were obtained from request cards and case files. Slides were retrieved from the archives of the Department of Pathology and reviewed. RESULTS: Sixteen cases of male breast cancer were encountered. This comprised 18.4% of the breast lesions in males and 2.8% of all breast cancers seen in the Department during the 20 year study period. The ages of patients ranged from 35-90 years with a mean age of 64.4 years. Delay in patient presentation to physician ranged from 14-49 months. Clinically, patients presented mostly with a self-detected lump (87.5%), or ulceration (68.8%), nipple discharge (43.8%) and nipple bleeding (25.0%). Unilaterality was observed in 87.5% of cases were while 12.5% of cases were bilateral (metachronous). Invasive ductal carcinoma (81.25%) was the predominant histological type of cancer. Stage IV disease was most commonly encountered (43.8%). Eleven (68.8%) patients had modified radical mastectomy. Only 31.3% patients came for follow-up, for a median duration of 10 months. CONCLUSION: Male breast cancer is rare and patients present late with advanced disease. Education needs to be intensified to increase awareness of the disease.},

	abstract = {Introduction: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that control gene expression by targeting mRNAs and triggering either translation repression or RNA degradation. Their aberrant expression may be involved in human diseases, including cancer. To test the hypothesis that there is a specific miRNA expression signature which characterizes male breast cancers, we performed miRNA microarray analysis in a series of male breast cancers and compared them with cases of male gynecomastia and female breast cancers.Methods: Paraffin blocks were obtained at the Department of Pathology of Thomas Jefferson University from 28 male patients including 23 breast cancers and five cases of male gynecomastia, and from 10 female ductal breast carcinomas. The RNA harvested was hybridized to miRNA microarrays (~1,100 miRNA probes, including 326 human and 249 mouse miRNA genes, spotted in duplicate). To further support the microarray data, an immunohistochemical analysis for two specific miRNA gene targets (HOXD10 and VEGF) was performed in a small series of male breast carcinoma and gynecomastia samples.Results: We identified a male breast cancer miRNA signature composed of a large portion of underexpressed miRNAs. In particular, 17 miRNAs with increased expression and 26 miRNAs with decreased expression were identified in male breast cancer compared with gynecomastia. Among these miRNAs, some had well-characterized cancer development association and some showed a deregulation in cancer specimens similar to the one previously observed in the published signatures of female breast cancer. Comparing male with female breast cancer miRNA expression signatures, 17 significantly deregulated miRNAs were observed (four overexpressed and 13 underexpressed in male breast cancers). The HOXD10 and VEGF gene immunohistochemical expression significantly follows the corresponding miRNA deregulation.Conclusions: Our results suggest that specific miRNAs may be directly involved in male breast cancer development and that they may represent a novel diagnostic tool in the characterization of specific cancer gene targets. © 2009 Fassan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Methods: This non-randomized retrospective study includes male patients with breast cancer confirmed by biopsy. A total of 1568 breast cancer patients were registered in the Oncology Department, Tripoli Medical Center, Tripoli, Libya between January 1990 to June 2008. Twenty-two patients were male (1.4%). Results: The mean age of male breast cancer patients was 61 years. They tend to have advanced local disease, as 65% of them were tumor (T)3 and T4, and 93.3% have positive lymph nodes. The preferred surgical treatment was mastectomy and axillary clearance in 65%, and 85% had invasive duct carcinoma. Regarding hormone receptor status, 70% were estrogen and progesterone positive. A total of 71% received chemotherapy as anthracycline based. During follow up, the overall recurrence rate was 47%. The bone was the most common site of relapse (37.5%). Overall survival rate was 82.4% at first, 76.5% at second, and 57% at fifth year. Two patients were brothers, and one of them developed multiple myeloma during follow up.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is an uncommon condition. It often occurs in settings in which there is an imbalance between androgens and oestrogens. Genetics plays an important role, as many cases are associated with mutations in BRCA2 or other genes. Male breast cancer occurs at an older age than female breast cancer and is frequently diagnosed at a later stage. Tumors are predominantly oestrogen and progesterone positive. Prognosis is approximately equivalent to that of breast cancer in females when matched for age, stage and hormonal receptors. The recommended treatment for male breast cancer is similar to that for breast cancer in postmenopausal females. However, the presence of androgens in males has a strong effect on the hormonal milieu and the ability of male patients to respond to hormonal agents. When pharmacologic treatment is required, tamoxifen is effective for first-line therapy. Other hormonal approaches such as orchiectomy, aromatase inhibitors and androgen ablation may be useful in later lines of therapy. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The objective of this study is to explore the perceptions and opinions about male breast cancer and male breast self-examination among male university students. Methodology: In-depth interviews were conducted among 36 male university students from the Management and Science University, Malaysia, selected by simple random sampling. The themes of the interview were: knowledge of male breast cancer and male breast self-examination, sources of knowledge and attitudes towards male BSE. The data obtained were classified into various categories and analyzed manually. Results: The majority of participants mentioned that there is a low possibility for males to get breast cancer. They also believed that the cause of breast cancer among men is due to the carcinogens from cigarettes. The majority of participants mentioned that they know about breast self-examination from the mass media and that the presence of a lump in the breast is the main symptom of breast cancer in men. The majority of participants mentioned that they encourage their family members to practice breast self-examination but considered that BSE is not important for men because they have a low probability of getting breast cancer. Conclusions: Misconceptions regarding male breast cancer and breast self-examination among men still exist among male university students. Therefore especial attention should be given to educate men about male breast cancer and male BSE.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is extremely rare, with an incidence in the general US population of <1%. It tends to be diagnosed at later stages than breast cancer in females, likely because of low awareness on the part of the patient and low suspicion by the physician. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, alterations to the estrogen-testosterone ratio, radiation exposure, and occupational hazards. Because of the rarity of MBC, mammography in men is more often utilized as a diagnostic tool to evaluate breast symptoms rather than as a tool for widespread screening. While clinical breast examinations are effective at evaluating breast symptoms, mammography also may be beneficial in separating malignant from benign breast disease. This study reviews MBC and its risk factors, recommendations for screening and diagnosis, the roles of mammography and genetic testing in surveillance, and management of patients with MBC.

	abstract = {Background: Approximately 2000 American men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. Limited data are available evaluating toxicity of antihormonal treatments in male breast cancer patients. Patients and methods: We reviewed male breast cancer patients evaluated at our institution (1999-2009). Of 126 patients, 64 met the following inclusion criteria: stage I-III, treated with tamoxifen, at least one follow-up visit after starting tamoxifen. A descriptive analysis of toxic effects was carried out on these 64 patients. Results: Median follow-up from start of tamoxifen therapy was 3.9 years (range 0.3-19.4 years). Median age at diagnosis was 61 years (range 30-79 years). Breakdown by stage: 29.7% (n = 19) stage I, 54.7% (n = 35) stage II, and 15.6% (n = 10) stage III. Thirty-four (53%) patients experienced one or more toxicity while taking tamoxifen. Most common toxic effects are weight gain (14 patients, 22%) and sexual dysfunction (14 patients, 22%). Thirteen (20.3%) patients discontinued tamoxifen due to toxicity: one ocular, one leg cramps, two neurocognitive deficits, two bone pain, three sexual dysfunction, and four thromboembolic events. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest study examining tamoxifen-related toxic effects among male breast cancer patients. Among male patients, there is a high rate of discontinuation of tamoxifen. Prospective studies of antihormonal agents in male breast cancer are warranted. © The Author 2011.

	abstract = {The term "familial male breast cancer" is often misleading, because in the breast cancer families reported in the literature, the vast majority of the patients were women and only a few were men. In this report, we present the rare case of a strictly defined familial male breast cancer (MBC) in which exclusively men were diagnosed with breast cancer. Three of four brothers developed the disease between the age of 46 and 64 years within a period of 21 years whereas all female relatives remained unaffected. The three affected men did not show the typical known clinical and genetic risk factors for MBC. An X-linked recessive inheritance may be possible in these cases. One way to potentially improve the identification of the causes of MBC could be a through a strictly studying families in which the male members were exclusively diagnosed with this malignancy. This approach emphasizes familial MBC as a distinct entity and not only as a variant of female breast cancer. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this pilot study was to explore with the breast care nurse specialist (BCNS) their perspectives on the information and support offered to male patients with breast cancer. The BCNS role is to provide the patient with both verbal and written information, and they are viewed as a key resource for the patients during their cancer journey. A qualitative method was adopted that utilised semi-structured interviews with the BCNS. The questions were derived from reviewing the literature and the written information available for the male patients; identifying key areas to explore and then utilising open ended questions to collect the data in the interviews. After each interview the transcripts were analysed and coded and further questions were formulated. The findings illustrate that although there is some gender specific information given, this is limited and often directs the patient to literature designed specifically for women. It is therefore recommended that a more comprehensive gender specific booklet be designed for men with breast cancer.

Influencing factors are: gynecomasty, familiarity for male breast cancer, Jewish and African-American male population. Fron the histological point of view, it is not different from the female breast cancer, except for the infiltrant ductal carcinoma, but with a much severe prognosis. Breast cancer metastases to the jaws are rare, only 1%; the most common sites of metastases are: lungs(59-69%), liver (58-65%), bone (44-71%), pleura (23-37%), brain (9-22%) and kidney (4-17%). At present, based on a literature research (May 2006), there have been just two other case reports of male breast cancer metastasis to the maxillofacial region, both to the mandible. The case of a 69-year-old white man who in 2001 underwent a radical mastectomy due to ductal breast cancer is reported. In 2005 the patient was referred to our department by his oncologist for multiple oral fistula. A mandibular TC revealed osteolytic lesions and the patient underwent mandibular surgery to remove the lesions and clean up the area. The histological examination was consistent with that of a metastatic deposit of adenocarcinoma of the breast. In June 2006 the patient died due to worsening of the general clinical conditions, in particular due to ascites and hepatic insufficiency.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most commonly treated malignancies worldwide, but is rare in males. Less than one percent of all breast cancers occur in men, and breast cancer comprises less than one percent of all male malignancies. Thus, clinical experience in managing this condition is limited. In contrast to female breast cancer, much remains unknown about breast cancer in males. While there are similarities between the two, emerging data suggest that there are perhaps more differences than previously thought. Nevertheless, much of how males with breast cancer are managed continues to be extrapolated from randomised trials performed in females, due to lack of data in the male population alone. Another poorly understood aspect is the psychological impact experienced by male patients when diagnosed with what is generally thought of as a female malignancy. This review will discuss the known epidemiology, demographics, risk factors and genetic predispositions surrounding the development of breast cancer in males; as well as current surgical and radiotherapeutic interventional techniques. Histological profiles and subtypes as well as hormone receptor and HER-2 receptor status are also discussed, with an overview of chemotherapy and hormonal strategies in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. © 2008 The Authors Journal Compilation © Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

	abstract = {Occurrence of male breast cancer, a rare disease, peaks at age 71 years. Familial cases usually have BRCA2 rather than BRCA1 mutations. Occupational risks include high temperature environments and exhaust fumes, but electromagnetic fields have not been implicated. Hyperoestrogenisation resulting from Klinefelter's, gonadal dysfunction, obesity, or excess alcohol, all increase risk as does exposure to radiation, whereas gynaecomastia does not. Presentation is usually a lump or nipple inversion, but is often late, with more than 40% of individuals having stage III or IV disease. Most tumours are ductal and 10% are ductal carcinoma in situ. Surgery is usually mastectomy with axillary clearance or sentinel node biopsy. Indications for radiotherapy, by stage, are similar to female breast cancer. Because 90% of tumours are oestrogen-receptor-positive, tamoxifen is standard adjuvant therapy, but some individuals could also benefit from chemotherapy. Hormonal therapy is the main treatment for metastatic disease, but chemotherapy can also provide palliation. National initiatives are increasingly needed to improve information and support for male breast cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a rare disease in men representing nearly 1% of the total breast cancer cases worldwide. Due to the low incidence, there are no randomized clinical studies giving information on the optimal diagnostics and therapy for male breast cancer patients. Therefore, treatment recommendations are derived from established guidelines for breast cancer in women. However, the lack of awareness of this disease leads to its detection at a later stage in men associated with a worse prognostic outcome. The gender-specific differences in breast cancer are among others related to the differing genetic and hormonal environment and the anatomic constitution in men. For example, males have a much higher percentage of hormone receptor-positive tumors but a significantly lower fraction of carcinomas overexpressing HER2. This review focuses on epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical findings of male breast cancer, and discusses current findings available to treat this disease. To optimize disease outcome and tolerability of treatment, these data should be considered to improve the therapeutic index of male breast cancer patients. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer is a comparatively rare disease, and simultaneous bilateral male breast cancer is considered to be an extremely rare event. Risk factors are said to be genetic factors and hormonal abnormalities due to obesity or testicular diseases. Case presentation: The patient was a 47-year-old Japanese male. His family had no history of female breast cancer. This patient also had hypospadias and hormonal examination indicated the presence of primary testicular potential hypogonadism, and these hormonal abnormalities seemed to be present since childhood or the fetal period. The bilateral breast cancer developed in this man at a comparatively young age, and histopathological studies of multiple sections showed that there was almost no normal epithelial cell in the ducts, while the ducts were almost completely filled with breast cancer cells. Conclusion: It is thought that male breast cancer is caused by an imbalance between estrogen and testosterone. We cannot rule out the possibility that the breast cancer developed due to the effect of the slight elevation of estrogen over a long period of time, but the actual causative factors in this patient were unable to be definitively identified. In the future, we hope to further elucidate the causes of male breast cancer. © 2007 Hirose et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer is a rare but aggressive and devastating disease. This disease presents at a later stage and in a more advanced fashion than its female counterpart. The immunophenotype also appears to be distinct when compared to female breast cancer. Angiogenesis plays a permissive role in the development of a solid tumor and provides an avenue for nutrient exchange and waste removal. Recent scrutiny of angiogenesis in female breast cancer has shown it to be of significant prognostic value. It was hypothesized that this holds true in invasive ductal carcinoma of the male breast. In the context of male breast cancer, we investigated the relationship of survival and other clinico-pathological variables to the microvascular density of the tumor tissue. Methods: Seventy-five cases of primary male breast cancer were identified using the records of the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency over a period of 26 years. Forty-seven cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the male breast had formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks that were suitable for this study. All cases were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for the angiogenic markers (cluster designations 31 (CD31), 34 (CD34) and 105 (CD105), von Willebrand factor (VWF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)). Microvascular density (MVD) was determined using average, centre, and highest microvessel counts (AMC, CMC, and HMC, respectively). Statistical analyses compared differences in the distribution of survival times and times to relapse between levels of MVD, tumor size, node status and age at diagnosis. In addition, MVD values were compared within each marker, between each marker, and were also compared to clinico-pathological data. Results: Advanced age and tumor size were related to shorter survival times. There were no statistically significant differences in distributions of survival times and times to relapse between levels of MVD variables. There was no significant difference in MVD between levels of the different clinico-pathological variables. MVD was strongly and significantly correlated between AMC, CMC and HMC for CD31, CD34, and CD105 (p < 0.01) and remained moderate to weak for VWF and VEGF. Conclusion: Microvascular density does not appear to be an independent prognostic factor in male breast cancer. However, the likelihood of death for men with breast cancer is increased in the presence of increased age at diagnosis and advanced tumor size. This is perhaps linked to inherent tumor vasculature, which is strongly related throughout a tumor section. © 2005 Frangou et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

A total of 225 male breast cancers was recorded after cancers other than breast cancer, but an increase was found only after lymphohaematopoietic neoplasms. BRCA2 (and to some extent BRCA1) mutations may explain the findings for pancreatic and prostate cancers. Increases at other sites may be related to unknown factors or to chance. This large study shows that the risks for second discordant tumours after male breast cancer pose only a moderate excess risk. © 2005 Cancer Research UK.},

	abstract = {Aims: To investigate expression of the steroid hormone receptors estrogen receptor (ER)-α and -β, progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) in male breast cancer. Methods: Specimens from 16 male breast cancers were immunostained for ERα, ERβ, PR and AR. Findings: Eighty-seven percent of tumours expressed ERα, 93% PR, 87% ERβ and 87% AR. Staining for ERα and PR was confined exclusively to the nuclei of epithelial cells with some heterogeneity. Nuclear immunoreactivity was also observed with AR. Again this was restricted to epithelial cells but tended to be more uniform. ERβ was seen in the nuclei of epithelial cells and also in stromal fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Analysis of serial sections revealed a similar pattern of staining with ERβ and AR in epithelial cells. Conclusions: In addition to expression of the better known steroid receptors, ERα, PR and AR, we have demonstrated a high rate of expression of ERβ in male breast cancer. This is in keeping with the generally high steroid receptor expression seen in males. However, the abundance of ERβ expressed in this small series of male breast cancer is in contrast to female breast cancer where ERβ expression is often reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to highlight the pattern of presentation and problems associated with management of this disease in Maiduguri, North Eastern Nigeria. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Case records of eleven (11) histologically diagnosed male breast cancers out of a total of two hundred and ninety-five (295) cases of breast cancer managed at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital between 1989-2003 were retrospectively studied and analysed. RESULTS: Male breast cancer constitutes 3.7% of all cases of breast cancers seen in this hospital during the study period under review. The male to female ratio was 1:26. The peak age range at presentation was 40-49 years and all were advanced at presentation. The time interval between onset of symptoms and presentation were all over 12 months. All the patients either had toilet mastectomy or modified radical mastectomy. In addition, two patients had sub capsular orchidectomy while nine had Tamoxifen. Four patients had additional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Two patients died in the course of follow-up while the rest were lost to follow-up shortly after discharge. Only one patient was followed-up for more than two years. CONCLUSION: Male breast cancer though rare, is a serious clinical problem associated with late presentation. It is hoped that increased public awareness will improve the outcome of management.},

	abstract = {The risk of second malignancies among female breast cancer patients has been studied for decades. In contrast, very little is known about second primary tumors in men. Risk factors for breast cancer in men, including genetic, hormonal and environmental factors, provide parallels to the etiology of breast cancer in women. This review considers the literature related to the risk of developing a second cancer in patients with male breast cancer. A systematic review of the literature between 1966 and 2007 was conducted and acceptable articles used for analysis. All retrieved articles were screened to identify any papers that had been missed. Studies were included if they discussed the risk of subsequent malignancy in patients with male breast cancer. Patients with history of male breast cancer have an increased risk of a second ipsilateral, or contralateral breast cancer (standardized incidence ratio 30-110). The risk of subsequent contralateral breast cancer was highest in men under 50 years of age at the time of the diagnosis of the initial cancer. The data on non-breast second primary cancers is diverse. One study has suggested an increased incidence of cancers of the small intestine, prostate, rectum and pancreas, and of non-melanoma skin cancer and myeloid leukaemia. Other investigators did not find an increase in the overall risk of subsequent cancer development in men diagnosed initially with primary breast cancer. Although sarcoma, lung and esophageal cancers are well recognized complications of radiation therapy for female breast cancer, there is no evidence for the association of these cancers following radiation therapy in male breast cancer. Although the incidence of second primary cancer in patients with primary male breast cancer requires further study, male breast cancer survivors should probably undergo periodic screening for the early detection of second breast cancers and other adverse health effects. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {While breast cancer (BC) is commonest malignancy among female with highest death rate, male breast cancer (MBC) is very rare but exhibits highest cancer specific death in men and the incidences of MBCs are rising rapidly. Due to rarity of the disease, no detail information about biomarkers and drug targets available and because of late diagnosis and rarely understood the pathogenesis at molecular level, the treatment of MBC is also not yet standardized. Though the MBC biology, pathogenesis, and the clinical outcomes resembles with female breast cancer (FBC), they are quite unique in many aspects. Therefore, the uses of FBC specific drugs for treatment of MBC are not only dissatisfactory but also increases mortality rate due to severe side effects of these conventional drugs. To avoid side effects of usual therapeutic drugs, new drugs and their targets should be identified and evaluated, where the dietary phytochemicals may be the alternative of currently used drugs. Similarly, an integrated strategy and pharmacogenomics approach is now essential to fight against this malady. This article will deal with different aspects of MBC including biomarkers, pathways, drug targets, and common dietary phytochemicals as effective alternatives of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs for targeted therapy without any side effect. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon neoplasm that shares several biologic characteristics with its female counterpart. In the latter, abnormalities in the expression and/or copy number of the ERBB2 gene are present in 10% to 30% of invasive carcinoma and behave as poor prognostic markers. ERBB2 abnormalities have also been reported in MBC, yet at lower frequency, but their prognostic significance remains controversial. Furthermore, no study has addressed the impact of chromosome 17 abnormalities in MBC survival. In this study, the ERBB2-gene status (overexpression and amplification) and chromosome 17 numerical abnormalities were investigated in a series of 50 archival cases of MBC. The results, together with patient's age, histologic grade, pathologic stage, and estrogen receptor status were correlated with overall survival. ERBB2-protein overexpression was present in 7 cases (14%), ERBB2-gene amplification in 4 (8%), and aneuploidy of chromosome 17 in 12 cases (33.3%). The pathologic stage, ERBB2 overexpression and ERBB2 amplification were significantly correlated with overall survival (P=0.002, 0.016, and 0.009, respectively). No correlation was observed between chromosome 17 aneuploidy and overall survival. Therefore, despite their low incidence in MBC, expression abnormalities of ERBB2 behave, together with the pathologic stage of the tumor, as predictors of overall survival, akin to what has been reported for its female counterpart.

There are no randomized data giving information on the optimal therapy for male breast cancer patients, thereby limiting firmer conclusions. The preferred primary surgical therapy is modified radical/simple mastectomy, but breast-conserving surgery has also been used in males. Post-operative radiotherapy should be used on a more routine basis; as males have shorter breast-anatomical distances and males are diagnosed at a later stage compared with females. The so far preferred adjuvant therapy modality has been tamoxifen for patients with endocrine responsive disease. The use of aromatase inhibitors in males is more controversial, since they may not deplete the estradiol levels sufficiently. Different chemotherapy regimens have been used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting. The use of adjuvant therapy has in institutional and review comparisons been demonstrated to result in an improved outcome. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: In recent years, increased advocacy for breast cancer awareness and research has resulted in a vast array of support services and progressive treatment strategies. Although rare, male breast cancer remains a substantial cause for morbidity and mortality in men. This is often explained by its late diagnosis. Method: Six men with breast cancer and five health professionals were interviewed to discuss their experiences with male breast cancer. All data were analyzed thematically. Discussion centered on patient encounters with breast cancer and details of its treatment. Results: Interviews highlighted the gender disparities within breast cancer research, treatment and services. Research into discussions in men's health often emphasizes masculinity as the main hindrance to men accessing health services and seeking medical consultation. However interviews demonstrated additional deterrents that obstruct men with breast cancer from benefiting from a full range of health services. These ranged from gendered assumptions of behavior and needs, inadequate awareness efforts and sources of information to inappropriate support options. Conclusions: Findings suggest that treatment for male breast cancer is hindered by responses and perceptions that are gender contingent. The lack of qualitative effort afforded to the experience of male breast cancer and the transfer of understanding of breast cancer from women to men fosters a misconstrued interpretation and comprehension of breast cancer in men, both medically and socially. Equally, this study demonstrates a need to redefine our current understanding of men's health in order to make services more accessible and compelling to men and that fit current male frameworks for accessing medical advice and coping with illness. © 2006 WPMH GmbH.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) commonly expresses hormone receptors and there is anecdotal evidence of disease responsivity to aromatase inhibitors in the metastatic setting. Our objectives were to: (i) assess clinical-pathologic characteristics in a consecutive cohort of MBC (ii) evaluate intratumoral aromatase (ITA) expression via tissue microarray (TMA) and (iii) assess the prognostic impact of ITA Methods: A retrospective review was conducted to identify all cases of MBC seen at the Nova Scotia Cancer Center between 1985 and 2005. Specimens were reviewed for standard pathologic characteristics and tumor blocks were incorporated into three TMA's (four 1 mm cores per tumor). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ER, PR, Her2-neu and ITA was performed blinded to clinical outcomes. ITA staining intensity was compared to control, benign hepatic tissue and if greater than or equal to liver was scored positive and if less than liver was scored negative. The log-rank test was used for survival comparisons and Kaplan-Meyer curves were used to estimate 3- and 5-year progression-free and overall survival probabilities. Results: Fifty-four cases were identified with a median age of 64 (31-85 years). Median tumor size was 2.6 cm (0.3-8.0 cm) and 22(41%) had nodal metastases. Forty-five cases had tissue available for IHC. Of these, 40 (89%) were ER and 33 (73%) were PR positive. Her2-neu was overexpressed in four cases (10%) and 12 (27%) were positive for ITA expression. ITA positive tumors were less likely to be grade 3, have lymphovascular invasion or nodal metastases and were more likely to be of favorable histology compared to ITA negative tumors. In univariate analysis strong (versus weak) ITA expression was associated with improved 5 year overall (92% vs. 49%, P = 0.038) but not progression-free (82% vs. 76% P = 0.44) survival rates. Conclusions: Tumors with strong ITA expression may have a less aggressive phenotype compared to those with negative/weak ITA expression. Further investigation of ITA as a relevant prognostic factor as well as a potential therapeutic target in MBC is warranted. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Aims: Male breast cancer incidence is 1% of all breast cancers and is increasing. We aim to present an overview of male breast cancer with particular emphasis on clinical management. Methods: Studies were identified by an online search of literature in the MEDLINE database till June 2006 followed by an extensive review of bibliographies. Results: Increased risk factors include genetic predisposition as in BRCA2 families; testicular dysfunction due to chromosomal abnormality such as Klinefelter's syndrome or environmental factors such as chronic heat exposure and radiation. Clinical assessment with biopsy is the hallmark of diagnosis. Earlier presentations are becoming commoner but there are wide geographical differences. Surgical treatment involves simple or modified radical mastectomy along with surgical assessment of the axilla, either via sentinel node biopsy in clinically node-negative disease or axillary sampling/clearance in node-positive disease. Reconstructions for restoring body image have been recently reported. Indications for adjuvant therapies are similar to that in women. For metastatic disease, tamoxifen is still the mainstay for oestrogen receptor positive disease. For oestrogen receptor negative disease, doxorubicin based chemotherapy regimens are used. In addition, the oft neglected psychological aspects of men having a "cancer of women" are increasingly being recognised. Conclusions: There is, thus, need for further increasing awareness among men to reduce stigma associated with presentation of symptoms related to breast. This should be in addition to stressing to clinicians the ways of earlier detection and tailor-made "gender oriented" treatment of breast cancer in men. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare with an incidence of 1% of all breast cancers. The evidence about the treatment is derived from the data on the management of the female breast cancer because conduction of randomized, controlled trials is impossible due to the rarity of the disease. In this study, we review the special features, overall management, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with MBC managed under our care with a brief review of the current literature. Methods: During the period 1998 to 2006, we managed 1103 new patients with breast cancer in St Mary's Hospital. Among these, 14 patients were men. We retrospectively reviewed the case notes, histology, and follow-up notes of all the newly diagnosed patients with MBC. Results: In this series, 28.6% had only in situ disease. Moreover, in 78.6% there was an in situ component present. One patient was found to have a cancer on the microdochectomy specimen after an operation for single duct nipple discharge, and in a second patient the cancer was found in the gynecomastia operation specimen. All ten invasive tumors were estrogen receptor positive (ER +ve), whereas eight were progesterone receptor positive (PgR +ve). With a median follow-up of 35 months, there was one locoregional recurrence and one disease-associated death. Conclusions: In situ cancer may not be as rare as previously reported among patients with MBC. Increased patient awareness and early assessment by a specialist is a key to early diagnosis and improved outcomes. © 2008 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer in men is an infrequent occurrence, accounting for ∼1% of all breast tumors with an incidence of about 1:100,000. The relative rarity of male breast cancer (MBC) limits our understanding of the epidemiologic, genetic and clinical features of this tumor. Methods: From 1997 to 2003, 10 MBC patients were referred to our Institute for genetic counselling and BRCA1/2 testing. Here we report on the genetic and phenotypic characterization of 10 families with MBC from the North East of Italy. In particular, we wished to assess the occurrence of specific cancer types in relatives of MBC probands in families with and without BRCA2 predisposing mutations. Moreover, families with recurrent BRCA2 mutations were also characterized by haplotype analysis using 5 BRCA2-linked dinucleotide repeat markers and 8 intragenic BRCA2 polymorphisms. Results: Two pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 gene were observed: the 9106C>T (Q2960X) and the IVS16-2A>G (splicing) mutations, each in 2 cases. A BRCA1 mutation of uncertain significance 4590C>G (P1491A) was also observed. In families with BRCA2 mutations, female breast cancer was more frequent in the first and second-degree relatives compared to the families with wild type BRCA1/2 (31.9% vs. 8.0% p = 0.001). Reconstruction of the chromosome phasing in three families and the analysis of three isolated cases with the IVS16-2A>G BRCA2 mutation identified the same haplotype associated with MBC, supporting the possibility that this founder mutation previously detected in Slovenian families is also present in the North East of our Country. Moreover, analysis of one family with the 9106C>T BRCA2 mutation allowed the identification of common haplotypes for both microsatellite and intragenic polymorphisms segregating with the mutation. Three isolated cases with the same mutation shared the same intragenic polymorphisms and three 5′ microsatellite markers, but showed a different haplotype for 3′ markers, which were common to all three cases. Conclusion: The 9106C>T and the IVS16-2A>G mutations constitute recurrent BRCA2 mutations in MBC cases from the North-East of Italy and may be associated with a founder effect. Knowledge of these two recurrent BRCA2 mutations predisposing to MBC may facilitate the analyses aimed at the identification of mutation carriers in our geographic area. © 2006 Miolo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Atlanta (GA): American Cancer Society; 2005]. The rarity of MBC has precluded major progress in the understanding and treatment of this disease. Treatment has often been extrapolated from female breast cancer (FBC) despite distinct clinicopathologic features between the two entities, especially with regards to the role of male hormones and estrogens in this disease. Also, it is uncertain if hormone receptor positive tumors carry the same prognostic implication in MBC as in the female disease. Hormonal therapy has been the mainstay of treatment in MBC with tamoxifen the front-line drug. The role of the newer generation aromatase inhibitors has not been well defined but they are being used in clinical practice for the treatment of MBC, based on accepted data for women with the disease. This commentary focuses on the major hormonal differences between male and female breast cancer that would suggest the need to explore different treatment strategies if significant advances are to be made in the understanding and treatment of this distinct disease. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer in men is an uncommon disease. Little is known about its etiology, clinical behavior, treatment, and outcome. Retrospective data indicate that stage- and age-matched male and female breast cancer is similar in presentation. The aim is to find an adequate treatment for male breast cancer, which is not just extrapolated from its female counterpart. Case Report: We present the history of a 41-year-old man who was diagnosed with pT2 (3 cm) breast cancer in 2001. After mastectomy without axillary dissection, 4 cycles of adjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamide and radiation therapy were performed followed by hormonal treatment with tamoxifen until 2003. In 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, there were relapses with skin metastases, treated with several courses of chemotherapy. In 2006, an inflammatory carcinoma in the contralateral breast was revealed during the course of epirubicin chemotherapy. In May 2007, the patient passed away from extensive tumor progression despite numerous attempts of local and systemic chemotherapeutic treatment. Conclusion: Here, an unusual case of male breast cancer is reported. It was first diagnosed at the age of 41 years, which is relatively young for male breast cancer. Although the treatment was started at an early stage, several relapses and contralateral breast cancer occurred within 5 years and could no be controlled. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.},

METHODS: A review of all cases of MBC seen at LAUTECH Teaching Hospital Osogbo between January 2004 and December 2006 was done. The age, presenting symptoms and signs, stage, histology, associated co-morbid illnesses, treatment and outcome of care were all retrieved and analysed. RESULTS: Seven (8.86%) out of seventy nine cases of breast cancers seen are males. Ages ranged between 38 and 80 years (mean 60.5 median 65 years). They all presented with advanced lesions after a 6 -36 months delay (mean-11.57 months). All were invasive ductal carcinoma. All the four with significant co-morbid illnesses died of them within one week to seven months. Only one patient had mastectomy. CONCLUSION: MBC constitutes 8.86% of all breast cancer, all presented late with advanced lesions and co-morbid illnesses contributed significantly to mortality.},

	abstract = {Purpose. The authors assessed mammographic and ultrasound (US) features and histological and biological characteristics of male breast carcinomas observed in five men (mean age 57.8 years) in a single year and compared the findings with the literature. Materials and methods. All patients underwent history taking and bilateral mammography and US examination extended to the axillary region and complemented with colour Doppler US. Results. Three out of five patients had a family history of breast cancer, and all of them had an altered energy balance (mean body mass index 30.8). All subjects had a palpable mass, which was associated with bloody nipple discharge in two cases. Mammography identified all lesions as opacities with irregular margins (mean size 1.98 cm); in one case, it also revealed a nonpalpable contralateral lesion. US demonstrated the presence of inhomogeneously hypoechoic nodules with irregular margins and centrifugal vascular spots in 4/6 lesions. Histology diagnosed invasive ductal cancer (IDC) in 5/6 lesions (83.3%) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the contralateral lesion only. Conclusions. The presence of symptoms warrants mammography, which is an accurate method for identifying male breast cancer. The frequency of invasive disease observed in our study was consistent with the literature (80%-90% IDC). The hormonal alterations induced by excess fat in our series appear to be correlated with the development of carcinomas with positive receptor status for both oestrogen and progesterone. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Aims: The prognostic factors and expression of molecular markers in male breast carcinomas are similar to those in female breast cancers. The identification of distinct cytokeratin (CK) profiles (basal as opposed to luminal cells) helps to identify subsets of tumours with different clinical behaviour. The aim of this study was to investigate CK expression in male breast cancer. Methods and results: Thirty-two cases of male breast cancer were studied. The panel of CKs studied by immunohistochemistry included: 5/6, 14, 17, 18 and 19. Pathological findings and CK expression were analysed in all cases. Histological patterns included ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive ductal carcinoma and mixed patterns. Four cases were positive for CK5/6 and CK14, identifying a basal-like phenotype. CK17 was negative in all but two cases. All cases expressing either CK5/6 or CK14 were invasive carcinomas of high nuclear and histological grade and were also larger compared with the tumours not expressing CK5/6 and CK14. All tumours except three (also negative for CK5/6) expressed CK18 and CK19. The four basal-like tumours were negative for Her-2 expression. Conclusions: Male breast carcinomas have a basal-like phenotype that is similar in frequency to that of female breast carcinomas.

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer is rare, and little is known about state population-level patterns of incidence. The primary objective of this study was to determine the incidence of MBC in Florida in comparison with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data. Methods: Study data were obtained from the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS). All males with pathologically confirmed invasive breast carcinoma diagnosed from 1985 to 2000 were included. Age-adjusted incidence rates, regional incidence rates, and descriptive statistics were calculated. Annual percent change (APC) for the study period was calculated with a linear model. Results were compared with the SEER data. Results: A total of 1396 cases of MBC were identified. Age-adjusted incidence rates increased from 0.9 cases per 100,000 in 1990 to 1.5 cases per 100,000 in 2000. In 2000, the highest rates were in the age groups of 70 to 75 years (7.9) and ≥85 years (12.5). Infiltrating ductal was the most common subtype (92%); less common subtypes included mucinous (2%) and papillary (2%). Localized disease accounted for 45% of all cases, with regional disease in 33%, distant metastases in 7%, and unstaged in 15%. Most incident cases were diagnosed in the Palm Beach-Broward region (23%). The number of cases increased from 56 in 1985 to 132 new cases in 2000. The APC for this 16-year period was 2.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-3.01; P < .005). SEER data indicated no change in MBC incidence rates (APC, 0.5; NS). Conclusions: The incidence of MBC in Florida increased significantly between 1985 and 2000. This finding is discordant with SEER incidence data. Further epidemiologic studies are warranted to investigate regional variation. Published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins © 2004 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Optimal management if male breast cancer (MBC) is not clearly established and treatment guidelines are scarce. We evaluated our own results in the treatment of male breast cancer patients with respect to local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and possible prognostic factors for survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with MBC were retrospectively studied to evaluate the results in this type of tumor; 94.8% had invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 2.6% invasive papillary carcinoma (IPC) and 2.6% invasive lobuler carcinoma (ILC). The distribution according to stage was 12.8%, 46.2%, 30.7% and 10.3% in Stages I, II, III and IV, respectively; 7.7% underwent radiotherapy (RT)+/-hormonotherapy (HT), 22.8% had chemotherapy (CT), 61.8% had chemoradiotherapy (CRT)+/-HT and 7.7% had HT in addition to surgery. RESULTS: The distant metastases rate was 36% and the local recurrence rate was 5%. All the local recurrences and the distant metastases had occurred after the first two years. The 2-year disease free survival (DFS) and OS rates were 87.2% and 89.7%, respectively, and the 5-year DFS and OS rates were 65.8% and 80.1%, respectively. In a univariate analysis for OS, statistical significance was found for lymph node metastases (P=.00001), stage (P=.0098) and age (P=.03), while presence of RT in the treatment modality (P=.6849), and tumor size (P=.4439) demonstrated no significance. The presence of lymph node metastases significantly impaired OS (P=.004) and DFS (P=.014) in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Postoperative radiotherapy was important in the management of MBC to improve LC resulting in one local failure, but did not improve OS and DFS. The presence of lymph node metastases significantly impaired OS and DFS.},

	abstract = {The spectrum of genetic alterations in primary male breast cancer is not well established. We analyzed chromosomal imbalances in 39 tumor samples from primary male breast cancer by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and correlated CGH findings with clinicopathological factors. Chromosomal gains were most frequent at 1q (46%), 8q (46%), 16p (36%), 17q (36%), Xq (28%), 20q (26%) and Xp (18%). Losses were most commonly observed at 8p (36%), 16q (28%), 13q (28%), 6q (18%), 11q (18%) and 22q (18%). Gains at 16p, 20q and Xq and losses at 13q correlated significantly with higher degree of cytogenetic complexity. Significant associations with clinicopathological factors were observed for +8q and -16q with larger tumor size and -16q with lower proliferative activity and lower grade of malignancy. A comparison with reported CGH data from female breast cancer showed a similar pattern of chromosomal imbalances, including +1q, -8p, +8q, -13q, +16p, -16q, +17q and +20q. Our results indicate that male breast cancer shares a common pattern of imbalances with female breast cancer, suggesting that similar genetic events may underlie the development and progression of male and female breast cancer. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Little information is available on the survival of male breast cancer patients because the disease is extremely rare in men. Recent studies indicated there were no gender-differences in the 5-year survival if patients' age and stage were matched. However, this problem has rarely been studied in Japan. Methods: Using the Osaka Cancer Registry's data, the 5-year survival was analyzed based on the reported 19 869 cases who lived in Osaka Prefecture excluding Osaka City and were diagnosed in 1975-1997, or who resided in Osaka City and were diagnosed in 1993-1997, because reliable follow-up information was available for them. Results: Breast cancer in males accounted for 0.49% of all cases during 1975-1997. The 5-year relative survivals were 71.1% in men and 81.6% in women. The survival in males decreased over older groups due to a lower proportion of localized stage, but not in females. The survival of males in the regional stage was significantly lower than that of females (49.1 versus 73.7%, P < 0.05). Survival of males has increased since 1980-1984, while it has been stable in females. Compared with the survival of patients diagnosed in 1975-1979, male patients diagnosed in 1995-1997 had a noticeably lower risk of death after adjusting for age and cancer stage. Conclusions: The results suggest male breast cancer patients at the regional stage had a worse 5-year survival rate compared to females. However, this gender-related difference seems to have disappeared with the increased survival of males during the 1990s. Further populationbased studies are required with a greater number of male patients diagnosed after 1990. © 2006 Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research.},

Methods: Information on all aspects of male breast cancer was gathered from available relevant literature on male breast cancer from the MEDLINE database over the past 32 years from 1975 to 2007. Various reported studies were scrutinized for emerging evidence. Incidence data were also obtained from the IARC, Cancer Mondial database. Conclusion: There is a scenario of rising incidence, particularly in urban US, Canada and UK. Even though more data on risk factors is emerging about this disease, more multi-institutional efforts to pool data with large randomized trials to show treatment and survival benefits are needed to support the existing vast emerging knowledge about the disease. © 2008 Contractor et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Due to its rarity, male breast cancer is not widely reported, especially in the Asian population. Methods: In a five-year review of our breast cancer surgery series, about 1.6 percent involved male patients. There was a substantial delay in presentation among those men, whose mean age at presentation was 64 years. Results: The majority of patients presented with a painless lump. Histologically, all tumours were ductal in origin and all patients had lower than stage III malignancies. The majority of patients underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection.

	abstract = {Breast cancer in men is a rare disease, accounting for ∼ 1% of all breast cancer cases. Although the epidemiologic literature regarding female breast cancer is extensive, relatively little is known about the etiology of male breast cancer (MBC). This review is intended to summarize the existing body of evidence on genetic and epidemiologic risk factors for breast cancer in men. Overall, the epidemiology of MBC presents similarities with the epidemiology of female breast cancer. Major genetic factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for men include BRCA2 mutations, which are believed to account for the majority of inherited breast cancer in men, Klinefelter syndrome, and a positive family history. Suspected genetic factors include AR gene mutations, CYP17 polymorphism, Cowden syndrome, and CHEK2. Epidemiologic risk factors for MBC include disorders relating to hormonal imbalances, such as obesity, testicular disorders (e.g., cryptorchidism, mumps orchitis, and orchiectomy), and radiation exposure. Suspected epidemiologic risk factors include prostate cancer, prostate cancer treatment, gynecomastia, occupational exposures (e.g., electromagnetic fields, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and high temperatures), dietary factors (e.g., meat intake and fruit and vegetable consumption), and alcohol intake.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Black women with breast cancer have poorer survival than do white women, but little is known about racial disparities in male breast cancer. We analyzed race and other predictors of treatment and survival among men with stage I-III breast cancer. Patients and Methods: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare database to identify men 65 years of age or older diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer from 1991 to 2002. Multivariate regression was used to compare those treated with those not treated with either chemotherapy or radiation therapy, adjusting for known clinical and demographic factors. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze survival. Results: Of 510 male breast cancer cases (456 white, 34 black), 94% underwent mastectomy, 28% received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 29% received radiation therapy. Among those with known hormone receptors, 95% had hormone-sensitive tumors. In a multivariate analysis, chemotherapy was associated with younger age, advanced stage, and hormone receptor-negative tumors. Radiation therapy was associated with younger age and advanced stage. Black men were approximately 50% less likely to undergo consultation with an oncologist and subsequently receive chemotherapy; however, the results did not reach statistical significance. The breast cancer-specific mortality hazard ratio was more than tripled for black versus white men (hazard ratio = 3.29; 95% CI, 1.10 to 9.86). Conclusion: After adjustment for known clinical, demographic, and treatment factors, there was an association of black race with increased male breast cancer-specific mortality. Although male breast cancer is rare, the reasons for these disparities need to be better understood. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

Risk factors for MBC are poorly understood and include working in high ambient temperatures and exhaust fume exposure. MBC is associated with hyperestrogenic states found in liver disease, KlinefelterÂi's syndrome, gonadal dysfunction or obesity. Most information on treatment of MBC is derived from large randomised trials carried out in female patients. The small numbers of MBC seen in any unit annually has precluded significant trials being carried out. Diagnosis and treatment of MBC is similar to that of female patients but men tend to be treated with mastectomy rather than breast conserving surgery. The mainstay of adjuvant therapy or palliative treatment for advanced disease is endocrine, mostly tamoxifen. Prognosis of male patients is equal to that of stage-matched women, but men tend to fare worse because of delay in presentation leading to a large proportion of patients presenting with stage III or IV disease. Increased input is needed for psychological support for male breast cancer patients. Specific therapeutic questions about MBC need international trials to obtain meaningful answers.},

The idea of living with a feminized illness was very distressing and stigmatizing for some men. Furthermore, treatment resulted in a profound change to the concept of their embodied selves and constituted a significant change to body image and sexuality. This was reinforced in participants who experienced erectile dysfunction related to tamoxifen therapy. Sadly, some health professionals were unable to offer specific psychosocial support, and participants felt marginalized from the potential benefits of the treatment environment. However, participants adapted to the illness by reasserting and renegotiating masculinity and finding ways to accommodate life with a stigmatizing condition and an altered body image. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

Forty-one patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana between 1970 and 2006 were proposed to take part in this study. Of them, 27 agreed to follow a genetic counseling session and 25 patients agreed to provide a blood sample for genetic testing. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from the MBC patients were screened for four highly recurrent mutations in the Slovenian population. When an additional breast cancer case or an ovarian cancer was present in the family, a more extended analysis was performed. No BRCA1 mutations were found. A BRCA2 gene mutation was identified in four MBC patients. Three of them carried the Slovenian founder mutation IVS16-2A>G. All four mutations were confined to the patients with a family history of breast cancer. Among the MBC patients with a family history of breast cancer in the first- or second-degree relatives, the frequency of BRCA2 gene mutation was 50%. The median age of the patients with a BRCA2 gene mutation was 60 years, not significantly different from those without a mutation.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare and poorly known disease. Germ-line mutations of BRCA2 and, to lesser extent, BRCA1 genes are the highest risk factors associated with MBC. Interestingly, BRCA2 germ-line rearrangements have been described in high-risk breast/ovarian cancer families which included at least one MBC case. Germ-line mutations of CHEK2 gene have been also implicated in inherited MBC predisposition. The CHEK2 1100delC mutation has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer in men lacking BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Intriguingly, two other CHEK2 mutations (IVS2+1G>A and I157T) and a CHEK2 large genomic deletion (del9-10) have been associated with an elevated risk for prostate cancer. Here, we investigated the contribution of BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 alterations to MBC predisposition in Italy by analysing a large series of MBC cases, unselected for breast cancer family history and all negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 germ-line mutations. A total of 102 unrelated Italian MBC cases were screened for deletions/duplications of BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. No BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 genomic rearrangements, including the CHEK2 del9-10, were found in the series analysed. Furthermore, none of the MBC cases and 263 male population controls, also included in this study, carried the CHEK2 1100delC, IVS2+1G>A and I157T common mutations. Overall, our data suggest that screening of BRCA1/2 rearrangements is not advantageous in MBC cases not belonging to high-risk breast cancer families and that common CHEK2 mutations play an irrelevant role in MBC predisposition in Italy. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease and little is known about its aetiology. Germ-line mutations of BRCA2 and, at lower frequency, of BRCA1 are implicated in a relatively small proportion of MBC cases. Common polymorphic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may represent breast cancer (BC) susceptibility alleles and could be associated with a modestly increased risk of MBC at population level. Considering the relevant role of BRCA2 in MBC, we investigated whether the BRCA2 N372H variant, representing the only common non-synonymous polymorphism in BRCA2, might modulate the risk of BC in male populations. Methods: A case-control study was performed comparing a population-based series of 99 MBC cases, characterized for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, with 261 male population controls, all residing in Tuscany, Central Italy. All MBC cases and controls were genotyped for the BRCA2 N372H allele by TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. To evaluate the genotype specific risk of the BRCA2 N372H variant, MBC carriers of germ-line BRCA1/2 mutations were excluded from the analyses. Results: No association emerged in univariate and age-adjusted analyses. Age-specific analyses suggested an increased risk for the HH homozygous genotype in subjects younger than 60 years. A statistically significant interaction emerged between this genotype and age (p = 0.032). When analyses were restricted to MBC cases enrolled in the first 4 years following diagnosis, a recessive model showed a significantly increased risk of MBC in HH subjects younger than 60 years (OR = 5.63; 95% CI = 1.70;18.61). Conclusion: Overall, our findings, although based on a relatively smallseries, suggest that the BRCA2 HH homozygous genotype might be positively associated with an increased risk of MBC in men younger than 60 years. © 2007 Palli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

It is possible that, because male patients are unaware of male breast cancer, there is a delay of diagnosis and, consequently, more advanced stages are commonly encountered in these patients. Some studies have engaged in molecular studies of male breast cancers because of the possibly different characteristics, prognosis, and treatment between male and female malignancies. However, a dearth of studies still exists, most likely because of the rarity of the disease and lack of a large patient base for study. Among the molecular markers of breast cancer, p53, Ki-67, HER-2/neu, and Bcl-2 are the most frequently studied. Here we present two rare cases and a review of the literature concerning the relationship between immunohistochemical markers and their impact in order to provide surgeons with more information about the disease and further techniques for treatment of these patients. © 2006 Elsevier.

Second cancers developed during endocrine therapy with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) after the initial surgeries. Since their second surgeries, both patients continued treatment with another SERM, because their second cancers were also hormone receptor-positive. We discuss the endocrine therapy in men based on a review of the literature. Conclusions: Adequate treatments for early MBC are still controversial. Aromatase inhibitors (AI) are not as effective in men as in women. We consider the higher androgen levels in men to be a major reason for AI not being as effective as expected, i.e. the hormonal environment is very different from that in women. Thus, different approaches are needed for MBC. With further investigation, it is hoped that methods of achieving maximal AI efficacy for MBC will be established. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.},

	abstract = {Genetic events underlying the pathogenesis of breast cancer have been studied extensively and several clinically significant markers have been identified. For example, amplification and over-expression of the ERBB2 oncogene is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and ERBB2 serves as a target for antibody-based therapy. Current knowledge on the pathogenesis of male breast cancer (MBC) is limited. The purpose of our study was to investigate the potential relevance of a series of genes known to be amplified in female breast cancer (FBC) in a the development and pathogenesis of MBC. To this end, we applied fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to the analysis of 128 breast tumors from males. Amplification of ERBB2, MYC, PPMID and ZNF217 was detected rarely (1-2% of tumors) indicating a considerably lower amplification frequency than in FBC. CCND1 amplification was observed in 12% of cases, being in good concordance with findings from FBC. In addition, CCND1 overexpression was detected in 63% of tumors and was associated with ER positivity (p < 0.0001). Our results indicate distinct differences in the genetic basis of MBC and FBC and suggest that marked differences exist in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The lack of ERBB2 involvement was especially unexpected and implies that ERBB2-targeted therapies are unlikely to be beneficial in MBC. Furthermore, the high frequency of hormone receptor positivity and the association between ER positivity and CCND1 overexpression supports the notion that hormonal regulation is likely to be essential for the development of MBC. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

MBC accounts for approximately 1% of breast cancer patients. A total of 182 men died of breast cancer in 1999, in Germany. In the US, 1500 new cases per year occur. MBC accounts for <5% of surgically removed breast lumps. Diseases with increased oestrogen action increase the risk of MBC. Mutations of distinct genes are estimated to account for up to roughly 10% of MBC. BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are responsible for approximately 80% of the families with hereditary breast cancer. The diagnosis of MBC is not possible without histological examination. Different diagnostic procedures such as clinical diagnosis, sonography, mammography, fine-needle biopsy and core needle facilitate the decision whether a biopsy is necessary.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Breast cancer in men is rare. The evidence about treatment has been derived from data on the management of the disease in women. The usual treatment is for male patients to undergo modified radical mastectomy. There is insufficient experience of breast conserving surgery with preservation of the nipple. The management of patients who demand such an approach for personal reasons remains a challenge for both the surgeon and oncologist. Case presentation: A 50-year-old man with a breast cancer was successfully managed with breast conserving surgery with nipple preservation combined with axillary clearance and postoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone treatment. Since there are no similar cases in the literature, we discuss the feasibility, safety and possible indications of such an approach. Conclusion: Despite the limited indications and evidence about the safety and efficacy of breast conserving surgery with nipple preservation in men with breast cancer, it is a feasible approach if other options are declined by the patient. More studies are necessary to reach firm conclusions about the safety of such an approach. © 2008 Lanitis et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {The association of male breast cancer (MBC) with a positive breast cancer (BC) family history and with BRCA1/2 germ-line mutations points to a genetic component; a relationship with occupation has also been reported. Recently, we identified pathogenetic BRCA1/2 mutations in a population-based series of Italian MBC patients: here in, we investigated interactions between a carrier status for BRCA1/2 mutations and occupation using a case-case design and estimating case-only odds ratios (CORs). Truck-driving was the most frequent occupation (3/4 BRCA-related cases and 2/19 unrelated cases). An interaction between carrier status and working as a truck-driver emerged, when we classified MBC cases as "ever/never-held" this job title (COR 25.5; 95% Confidence Limits (CL): 1.1-1,412.5) or according to truck-driving as the "longest-held" work (COR 54.0; 95% CL: 1.6-2,997.5). The possible modifying effect on MBC risk in subjects carrying BRCA1/2 germ-line mutations of an occupation characterised by exposure to chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) that are capable of inducing DNA damage, may provide clues to the role of environmental exposures in modifying BC risk in mutation carriers in both genders. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Coming from a female patient's point of view, breast cancer is a hard to bare diagnosis. But what about the male patient? Although is very rare, male breast cancer does exist, and in the majority of cases, it is diagnosed in a very advanced stage with minimal curative possibilities. The critical medical education in our country along with the absence of a well structured national screening program are both provocative factors for the existence of this kind of disease. This work is based upon a retrospective study on 976 patients (919 females and 57 males) who were diagnosed and requiring medical treatment for mammary neoplasm between 2001-2006 under the auspices of the 2nd Surgery Clinic inside the Clinical and Emergency District Hospital of Constanta. From all the patient's anamnestic common elements like smoking, liver diseases, stress, radiation exposure, family antecedents that are related to the actual suffering, we can draw a general installation pattern of cancer. This study is meant to point out the similarities and especially the differences between the specialised bibliography and the collected information from the existing pathology concerning the age incidence, the type of neo formation, the location, histo-pathologic diagnosis, the types of surgical procedures and also to make evident the causes producing delay in starting the surgical treatment with visible consequential effects on both surviving and the quality of life.

	abstract = {Introduction. Male breast cancer comprises about 1% of all breast cancer cases. The advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis is connected with shorter overall survival rates when compared to female patients. We estimate 1, 2, 3, and 5-year overall survival rates in male breast cancer patients treated in the Institute of Oncology in Gliwice between 1996 and 2007, and to evaluate potential prognostic factors influencing patients' survival rate. Material and methods. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 61 males treated due to breast carcinoma in the Institute of Oncology between 1996 and 2007. The median age was 61 years. The majority of patients were diagnosed in an advanced stage: T3-4 51%, N1-3 46%, M1 11%. The most represented histological type was invasive ductal carcinoma (46%). Tumors were estrogen-receptor positive in 46% and progesterone- receptor positive in 41% of cases. Of the 45 patients who were treated radically, surgery was performed in 84%. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed in 20% and adjuvant in 36% of patients. Adjuvant hormonal therapy was administered to 62%. Palliative treatment was administered to 26% of patients. Results. The 5-year overall survival rates in the palliative and radical group were 35% and 59%, respectively (p = 0.01). In radically-treated patients 5-year diseasefree survival was 48%. The variables with the strongest positive influence on the total survival rate included adjuvant hormonal therapy (p = 0.006) and radical surgery (p = 0.01). The use of chemotherapy had no significant influence on overall survival (p = 0.06). Radiotherapy (p = 0.8) had no influence on overall survival. Conclusions. Radical mastectomy is the treatment of choice for male breast cancer patients. Negative receptor status has the most significant negative influence on survival.},

In the prospective National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study, we studied 324 920 men, among whom 121 developed breast cancer. Men who reported a first-degree relative with breast cancer had an increased risk of breast cancer (relative risk [RR] = 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to 3.09). Among the medical conditions examined, a new finding emerged regarding increased male breast cancer risk associated with a history of a bone fracture (RR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.24 to 3.91). Obesity was positively related to risk (RR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.10 to 2.91, for body mass indices of ≥30 vs <25 kg/m2) and physical activity inversely related, even after adjustment for body mass index. Smokers were at somewhat elevated risk, although trends with smoking characteristics were inconsistent. Alcohol consumption was not related to risk. The identified risk factors show some commonalities with female breast cancer and indicate the importance of hormonal mechanisms. Differences in risk factors may reflect unique mechanisms associated with androgens and their ratio to bioavailable estrogens.},

	abstract = {Background: Little emphasis has been placed today on the elucidation of protein alterations in male breast carcinogenesis. Methods: Protein extracts were subjected to both isoelectric focusing (IEF) and non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoretic (NEPHGE) analyses. Differentially expressed proteins in tumor tissues were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption /ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and database search. Results: Some of the alterations involve variations in the expression of cytokeratins 8, 18 and 19. More interestingly, tropomyosin1, a protein known to play a role in suppression of the malignant phenotype, was found to be under-expressed in cancer tissues, implicating a possible pivotal role for this protein in male breast carcinogenesis. Co-upregulation of molecular chaperones (heat shock protein HSP27 and protein disulfide isomerase), stress related proteins (peroxiredoxin 1 and peptidylprolyl isomerase A) and glycolytic enzymes (enolase 1) occurred also in male breast tumors. Some of the remaining alterations include proteins involved in invasion and metastasis, such as galectin 1 and cathepsin D. Conclusions: The present study represents a first proteomic investigation of protein alterations in infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDCA) of the male breast. A number of protein alterations in tumor tissues have been characterised thus, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Patients and Methods: A slide review was performed for nuclear grade, lymphocytic infiltration, and lymphatic and vascular invasion. Flow cytometry was available on all the specimens. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess p53, estrogen receptors (ERs), cathepsin D, Ki-67, and c-erbB-2 (HER2/neu). A clinical correlation was performed based on chart reviews and phone interviews, recording demographics, treatment, and long-term survival. Results: The average age at diagnosis was 64 years (range, 34-85 years). There were 15 T1 lesions, 2 T2 lesions, and 1 T3 lesion. All patients had a modified radical mastectomy. None received radiation therapy. The mean follow-up was 73 months. Three patients died of their disease (17.6%), 2 patients died from unrelated reasons, 1 patient was lost to follow-up, and the other 12 patients are alive with no evidence of disease. The actuarial 5-year survival was 83%. Estrogen receptor and HER2/neu overexpression were significantly more predominant in male breast cancer than in female breast cancer. Estrogen receptor positivity was present in 17 of 18 patients and HER2/neu overexpression in 10 of 18. A positive ER status and overexpression of cathepsin or p53 were correlated with a better survival, but only ER (P = 0.026) and p53 (P = 0.023) reached statistical significance. Conclusion: In this study, ER status was the only commonly used prognostic marker for female breast cancer found to be applicable in node-negative male breast cancer.},

We sought to determine the incidence of prostate cancer in male breast cancer patients at our institution, and to examine estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER-2/ neu receptor (HR) status in these patients. A retrospective review was conducted of male breast cancer patients from 1990 to 2006. Histopathologic characteristics and hormone receptor expression was obtained. In 69 patients with male breast cancer, 12 (17%) also had a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Nine had ER-positive status and three were unreported. PR status was positive in 5, whereas 3 had PR-negative status. HR status was positive in 1, whereas 5 had HR-negative status. Male breast cancer patients in this cohort have an incidence of prostate cancer higher than would be predicted in the general population; this risk factor has implications for careful prostate cancer screening.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND. The incidence of male breast cancer (MBC) continues to rise. The Veterans Affairs (VA) Central Cancer Registry (VACCR) provides a unique source for the study of MBC. The objective of this retrospective analysis was to compare the characteristics and outcome of patients with MBC and patients with female breast cancer (FBC) in the VA population. METHODS. VACCR data were used to analyze the database of VA patients who had breast cancer diagnosed between 1995 and 2005. It includes 120 VA medical centers. Primary site codes were identified for breast cancer (500-508). Data were entered and analyzed using biostatistical software. RESULTS. In total, 3025 patients' records were reviewed, and 612 patients who had MBC were compared with 2413 patients who had FBC. The mean age at diagnosis was 67 years for patients with MBC and 57 years for patients with FBC (P < .005). More patients with MBC were black, and patients with MBC presented with higher disease stage and more lymph node-positive disease. The dominant histology in MBC was ductal carcinoma. No difference in grade or laterality was observed. Estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive tumors were more common in MBC compared with FBC. Overall, patients with MBC received less chemotherapy, whereas no statistical difference was observed in the use of hormone treatment. The median overall survival for patients who had MBC was 7 years compared with 9.8 years for patients who had FBC (log-rank test; P < .005). There was no statistically significant difference in median survival for patients with stage III disease and stage IV disease. However, the median survival differed significantly for patients with stage I disease and stage II disease. In lymph node-negative patients, the median survival was 6.1 years for patients with MBC and 14.6 years for patients with FBC (P < .005), whereas the median survival did not differ significantly in lymph node-positive patients. Using Cox regression analysis age, sex, clinical stage, and lymph node status were independent prognostic factors for survival, whereas race, histology, and grade were not. CONCLUSIONS. To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest series of MBC and FBC to date in the veterans population. The results suggested the presence of differences in the biology, pathology, presentation, ethnicity, and survival between patients with MBC and patients with FBC in the VA population. It is noteworthy that the survival of patients with MBC was inferior for those with early-stage disease and lymph node-negative tumors, suggesting that there are differences between the sexes in the pathogenesis and biology of breast cancer. In patients with hormone receptor-positive MBC, survival was inferior despite similar hormone treatment practices between MBC and FBC. This observational study calls for a better understanding of this disease that would allow new opportunities for specific therapeutic intervention. © 2007 American Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of male breast cancer (MBC). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 20 MBC patients in comparison with female ductal carcinoma treated at Yonsei University Severance Hospital from July 1985 to May 2007. Clinicopathological features, treatment patterns, and survival were investigated. Results: MBC consists of 0.38% of all breast cancers. The median age was 56 years. The median symptom duration was 10 months. The median tumor size was 1.7 cm, 27.8% showed node metastasis, and 71.4% were estrogen receptor positive. All 20 cancers were arisen from ductal cells. No lobular carcinoma was found. The incidence of stages 0, I, II, and III in patients were 2, 10, 4, and 3, respectively. All patients underwent mastectomy. One with invasive cancer did not receive axillary node dissection and stage was not exactly evaluated. Adjuvant treatments were determined by pathologic parameters and stage. Clinicopathological parameters and survival rates of MBC were comparable to those of female ductal carcinoma. Conclusion: The onset age of MBC was 10 years older and symptom duration was longer than in female patients. No difference in outcomes between MBC and female ductal carcinoma suggests that the biology of MBC is not different from that of females. Therefore, education, an appropriate system for early detection, and adequate treatment are necessary for improving outcomes.},

Patients and methods: Thirty-nine patients with male breast cancer have been retrospectively studied with the trial aim to evaluate the results of our practice. Among them, 94.8% had invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 2.6% invasive papillary carcinoma (IPC) and 2.6% invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and the distribution according to stage was found to be 12.8, 46.2, 30.7 and 10.3% in Stages I, II, III and IV, respectively. Among the patients, 7.7% received radiotherapy (RT) and hormonotherapy (HT), 22.8% received chemotherapy (CT), 61.8% received chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and HT and 7.7% received HT in addition to surgery. Results: The distant metastases rate was 36% and the local recurrence rate was 5%. All the local recurrences and the distant metastases had occurred after the first two years. The five-year disease free survival (DFS) and OS rates were 65.8 and 80.1% respectively. In our series, univariate analysis for OS demonstrated statistical significance for lymph node metastases (p = 0.00001), stage (p = 0.0098) and age (p = 0.03); while RT in the treatment modality (p = 0.6849), and tumor size (p = 0.4439) demonstrated no significance. The presence of lymph node metastases significantly impairs OS (p = 0.004) and DFS (p = 0.014) in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Postoperative radiotherapy was important in the management of male breast cancer to improve LC resulting in one local failure, but did not improve OS and DFS in our analysis. The presence of lymph node metastases significantly impaired OS and DFS. © 2009 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO).},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare clinical entity accounting for approximately 1 per cent of all breast cancers. The present study investigated changes in patient characteristics, disease patterns, treatment, and outcomes over a 30-year period. A retrospective chart review was performed on male breast cancer patients treated between 1975 and 2005 at Eastern VirginiaMedical School, Norfolk, VA. Demographic, pathologic, treatment, and survival information was collected. To facilitate comparison of trends, the patients were divided into two groups: Cohort A (1972-1991, previously reported) and Cohort B (1992-2005). Both cohorts included 28 male patients. Comparing the cohorts, no statistical differences were noted in median age, ethnicity, presenting symptoms, or progesterone receptor status. In Cohort A, 70 per cent of patients were estrogen receptor positive, compared with 100 per cent of Cohort B (P = 0.02). Her2/neu was positive in three of five patients in Cohort B. There was a trend toward more conservative surgery, with no radical mastectomy or orchiectomy performed in Cohort B. Only two patients had sentinel lymph node mapping, both from Cohort B. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was more prevalent in Cohort B (P = 0.04). For Cohort A and B, 5-year survival was 43 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively, which was not statistically significant. For male breast cancer, radical mastectomy is no longer a common treatment modality. Male breast cancer of today is more hormonally responsive which may have important implications for therapy. Survival has not significantly improved over the previous 30 years. Compilation of multi-institutional data of male breast cancer is needed to advance the treatment of this uncommon disease.},

On the basis of the literature review the authors tried to determine the main characteristics of this rare neoplasm in terms of epidemiology, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and survival. Methods. The authors report the experience of the Breast Unit of the San Giovanni - Addolorata Hospital in Rome, where 4 cases of male breast cancer were observed and treated over 784 breast cancers. Results. All tumours were ductal carcinomas. The extent of disease was as follows: 3 cases with stage I and 1 case with Stage IIIB; in two cases estrogen and progesterone receptors expression was 100% and in the other two cases it was 20-80%. Median follow up was 57.5 months. At present, after 6-year follow up the three patients with stage I are in good conditions; the patient with stage III died after 27 months with metastatic disease. Conclusions. Surgical treatment remains the gold standard in male breast cancer. The prognosis for males with breast cancer is similar to female patients on equal terms of stage of disease. Adjuvant therapy is based on retrospective studies of male breast cancer conducted over the past 20 years using the guidelines for breast cancer in women.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer among males is rare, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancers in the United States. Although it is rare, it can cause significant morbidity and mortality. We analyzed data from 1759 California males whose diagnosis of breast cancer was made between 1988 and 2000 and reported to the population-based California Cancer Registry. Cases were primary, microscopically confirmed in situ and invasive breast cancer. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 men were highest in Blacks (1.65), intermediate in whites (1.31) and lowest in Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders (0.68, 0.66, respectively). Age at diagnosis differed by race (p = 0.001) with blacks diagnosed at an earlier age than whites or Asians/Pacific Islanders. Stage at diagnosis also differed by race (p = 0.001) with blacks more likely to be diagnosed at distant stage. Further investigation showed that blacks and Hispanics were more likely to be diagnosed with tumors 5 cm in diameter or greater. The proportion of men having surgery following a diagnosis of breast cancer also varied by race/ethnicity (p = 0.001) with blacks least likely to have surgery following diagnosis. Understanding racial/ethnic variation in male breast cancer may provide clinical and etiologic implications for breast cancer in different populations. © Springer 2005.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the possible link between androgen hyposensitivity caused by long androgen receptor (AR) CAG repeats, and breast carcinogenesis, in men. AR gene mutations have been described in men with androgen insensitivity syndrome and breast carcinoma, and some studies have shown long CAG repeats are associated with increased risk of breast cancer in women. DNA was isolated from male breast cancer biopsies, and the AR CAG repeat sized. Forty one male breast cancer samples were studied, including one sample from a man with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), which is caused by an AR CAG repeat expansion. The man with breast cancer and SBMA had 49 CAG repeats (normal range 6-35), but all other breast cancer samples had repeats within the normal range. The frequency of CAG repeats ≥24 was significantly higher in the breast cancer group (excluding the SBMA subject) than in the normal population (p < 0.05), and was more marked in grade I and II tumors (p = 0.001). There was no correlation between AR CAG repeat length and age at diagnosis. In conclusion, longer AR CAG repeats are more common in men with breast cancer than in the control male population. Androgen hyposensitivity, caused by long AR CAG repeats, may increase the risk of breast cancer in men.},

Carcinoma metastatic to the male breast is also unusual, with metastatic prostatic carcinoma being among the most common primary sites from which such tumours derive. Metastatic prostatic cancer and primary breast cancer may be histologically indistinguishable without immunohistochemistry because both often infiltrate with a cribriform architecture. Distinguishing between primary and metastatic disease within the breast is important because the treatment options for each are radically different. Following a case in which metastatic prostatic disease was initially wrongly diagnosed as primary breast cancer, a small series of male breast cancers was examined for expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic acid phosphatase to assess the usefulness of these markers in making this distinction. Focal expression of PSA was found in one of 11 cases of male breast cancer. These results indicate that PSA should be used with caution in this context.},

Mutations in BRCA2 are mainly point mutations in contrast to BRCA1 in which large genomic rearrangements are quite common. In recent literature, however, genomic alterations of BRCA2 have been linked especially to male breast cancer families. We wanted to screen large genomic deletions and duplications of BRCA2 among Finnish male breast cancer patients. Methods: We used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to detect large genomic rearrangements in the BRCA2 gene among 36 unselected Finnish male breast cancer patients previously tested and found negative for Finnish BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations. Results: No genomic mutations of BRCA2 nor CHEK2*1100delC point mutations, also included in the assay, were found in this study. Conclusion: Large genomic BRCA2 rearrangements were not found among our 36 Finnish male breast cancer patients. Screening of large BRCA2 rearrangements is not likely to be advantageous in Finland. © 2006 International Society for Preventive Oncology.},

The therapy recommendations for males therefore lack the solid evidence, frequently present for females with breast cancer. The primary breast cancer diagnosis in males is not infrequently in stage III/IV and at higher age, thereby requiring multiprofessional and multimodal management including preoperative therapy and adjuvant therapies based on the tumour's biological characteristics and the clinical circumstances. The majority of male breast cancer tumours are oestrogen-receptor positive and adjuvant/neoadjuvant tamoxifen is therefore recommended, surgery is frequently radical mastectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy should likely be used on wider indications. Chemotherapy should be considered both in the adjuvant and metastatic setting for receptor-negative cancers and for patients with biologically aggressive disease. Trastuzumab should be offered to patients with Her-2/neu-positive disease, while the use of aromatase inhibitors is more uncertain due to differences in the hormonal environment in males. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

A population-based cohort of 269 male and 30.011 female breast cancer patients born after 1935 and diagnosed with primary breast cancer between 1970 and 1997 was generated by linking a number of Swedish registries, including the Swedish Cancer Registry, the Cause of Death Registry, the Swedish Generation Registry, and the Registry of Population and Population Changes. We used this cohort to quantify the association between the sex of the patient and breast cancer-specific mortality, using the Cox proportional hazards. The sex of the patient did not significantly influence the prognosis of breast cancer. Adjusting for age at diagnosis and calendar period did not alter the results. Nor did the results change when the analyses were repeated for all causes of morality. Our study, one of the largest to date, failed to find evidence to support the proposed association between the sex of breast cancer patients and survival. Given the previous reports, which advocated that male breast cancer patients have poorer survival and need aggressive treatment strategies, our findings are reassuring and clinically very important. © 2009 Japanese Cancer Association.},

	abstract = {Although screening for large deletions or duplications of the BRCA1 gene is becoming a routine component of the molecular diagnosis of familial breast cancer, little is known about the occurrence of such rearrangements in the BRCA2 gene. Because of the high frequency of BRCA2 mutations in breast cancer families with at least one case of male breast cancer, we selected a cohort of 39 such families, tested negative for mutations in the coding regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2, and developed an assay for BRCA2 rearrangements, based on quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF). We found three rearrangements: (1) a deletion of exons 12 and 13; (2) a duplication of exons 1 and 2; and (3) a complete deletion of BRCA2. We determined the boundaries of the deletion of exons 12 and 13, showing that it resulted from an unequal recombination between Alu sequences. We mapped the complete BRCA2 deletion, which extends over at least 298 kb and showed that it does not affect APRIN/AS3, previously characterized as a tumor suppressor gene, but it comprises several loci corresponding to proven or putative transcripts of unknown functional significance. These data suggest that screening for BRCA2 rearrangements should be done, especially in male breast cancer families tested negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.},

This lack of change is mostly attributable to a lack of major progress in the understanding and treatment of the disease. The treatment of MBC has been extrapolated from the knowledge of female breast cancer, despite the multiple differences in the pathogenesis, biology and genetics of these two disease entities, especially the differences with regard to the role of male hormones as well as estrogens in MBC compared with female disease. Although major advances in hormonal manipulation for the treatment of breast cancer are being developed, an improved understanding of the potential differences between male and female breast cancer is essential, as this would provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention and probable improved outcome for MBC. This review aims at highlighting the major differences between male and female breast cancer with an emphasis on hormonal therapy, and discusses some of the recent advances in MBC.},

Tamoxifen has proven to be successful in both adjuvant and metastatic settings and remains the standard of care. Given the improved outcomes in female patients with aromatase inhibitors (AI), these drugs have become a potential therapeutic tool for male patients. Preliminary data show effective suppression of oestradiol levels in males treated with AI and some reports have demonstrated objective responses.

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare type of neoplasm, being 1% of all breast tumors. An increasing relevance is given to genetic factors. Familiarity is present in 10% of cases reported in literature. Gynecomastia is frequently associated. Personal experience about this pathology is compared with the most recent data of the literature. Methods. Nine cases of male breast cancer observed among 519 breast tumors operated between 1982 and 1997 are reported. Etiologic and prognostic aspects, surgical and complementary therapy of breast cancer in man are examined and the high rate of II-III stage patients, mostly ER+ and PR+ is underlined. Diagnosis is reached by ultrasonography and mammography, after an accurate clinical examination and confirmed by cytology after needle biopsy. The choice operation is total mastectomy with axillary lymphoadenectomy according to Patey. Results. In our experience, 5 patients died for non neoplastic pathology, 1 patient lost at follow-up, 3 patients still alive after 66, 60 and 12 months respectively. Conclusions. Male breast cancer is similar to the female one, but characterized by a higher hormone receptors positivity. Our survival data have no statistic significance. It is still discussed if prognostic difference between men and women is present or not.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a rare disease in men. Germ-line mutations in BRCA2 and androgen receptor (AR) genes are thought to be responsible for a proportion of male breast cancer cases. The present study was performed on a series of 37 consenting patients not selected for family history of breast/ovarian cancer. The entire coding region of the BRCA2 gene and two exons of the AR gene were analyzed for germ-line mutations to evaluate the association between BRCA2 and AR genes and male breast cancer in Poland. We identified four frameshift mutations (11%) in exons 10, 11, 17 and 18, two of them were novel: 6495del3insC and 8457insA. Three missense unclassified variants (8%) of the BRCA2 gene were also identified. The frequencies of missense alterations were examined in a set of 200 chromosomes. No alteration of the AR gene was found. We did not observe much difference in clinicopathological features between carriers and non-carriers of BRCA2 mutations. Five of 37 patients (14%) had a family history of breast cancer, in one first- or second-degree relative, among the latter was one mutation carrier. The results of this study suggest that germ-line BRCA2 mutations account for rather small proportion of male breast cancer in Poland. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: The contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to the incidence of male breast cancer (MBC) in the United Kingdom is not known, and the importance of these genes in the increased risk of female breast cancer associated with a family history of breast cancer in a male first-degree relative is unclear. Methods: We have carried out a population-based study of 94 MBC cases collected in the UK. We screened genomic DNA for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and used family history data from these cases to calculate the risk of breast cancer to female relatives of MBC cases. We also estimated the contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to this risk. Results: Nineteen cases (20%) reported a first-degree relative with breast cancer, of whom seven also had an affected second-degree relative. The breast cancer risk in female first-degree relatives was 2.4 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-4.0) the risk in the general population. No BRCA1 mutation carriers were identified and five cases were found to carry a mutation in BRCA2. Allowing for a mutation detection sensitivity frequency of 70%, the carrier frequency for BRCA2 mutations was 8% (95% CI = 3-19). All the mutation carriers had a family history of breast, ovarian, prostate or pancreatic cancer. However, BRCA2 accounted for only 15% of the excess familial risk of breast cancer in female first-degree relatives. Conclusion: These data suggest that other genes that confer an increased risk for both female and male breast cancer have yet to be found.},

	abstract = {Cowden syndrome (CS) (OMIM 158350) is a multiple hamartoma syndrome associated with germline mutations in the PTEN tumour suppressor gene. While CS is characterised most commonly by noncancerous lesions (mucocutaneous trichilemmomas, acral and palmoplantar keratoses, and papillomatous papules), it is also associated with an increased susceptibility to breast cancer (in females) and thyroid cancer, as well as noncancerous conditions of the breast and thyroid. Here we report two cases of male breast cancer occurring in patients with classical CS phenotypes and germline PTEN mutations. The first subject was diagnosed with CS indicated primarily by mucocutaneous papillomatosis, facial trichilemmomas, and macrocephaly with frontal bossing at the age of 31 years. He developed breast cancer at 41 years and subsequently died of the disease. A PTEN mutation, c.802delG, was identified in this subject, yet none of his family members showed evidence of a CS phenotype, suggesting that this PTEN mutation may be a de novo occurrence. The second subject had a CS phenotype including multiple trichilemmomas and thyroid adenoma, developed male breast cancer at 43 years, and died of the disease at 57 years. He was a carrier of a PTEN mutation c.347-351delACAAT that cosegregated with the CS phenotype in affected family members. These two cases of male breast cancer associated with germline PTEN mutations and the CS phenotype suggest that CS may be associated with an increased risk of early onset male as well as female breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The etiology of male breast cancer is obscure, although an excess risk has been associated with Klinefelter syndrome, testicular disorders, benign breast disease including gynecomastia, use of exogenous estrogens, radiation, and a family history of male or female breast cancer. We conducted a case-control study to investigate risk factors further for breast cancer in men. Methods: Based on data from the 1986 National (United States) Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS) of almost 20,000 deceased adults (age 25 years or over), we compared information obtained from next-of-kin interviews of 178 men who died of breast cancer with that of 512 male controls who died of other causes. Information was obtained on selected demographic and other factors, including diet, exercise, occupation, height and weight, and use of tobacco and alcohol. Results: Increased risks were found for men who were described by their next-of-kin as very overweight (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-5.0). The risks associated with the three upper quartiles of body mass index (BMI) (wt/ht2) were 1.3, 1.6, and 2.3, respectively, with a significant dose-response relationship (P < 0.01). An excess risk was also associated with limited exercise (OR = 1.3, CI = 0.8-2.0). Consumption of red meat was associated with an increased risk, and consumption of fruits and vegetables with a decreased risk, although the trends were not significant. No association was found for tobacco or alcohol use, but an excess risk was associated with higher levels of socioeconomic status (SES) (OR = 1.8, CI = 1.1-3.0). Conclusions: Our study suggests that obesity increases the risk of male breast cancer, possibly through hormonal mechanisms, while dietary factors, physical activity, and SES indicators also deserve further investigation.},

Predisposing factors include increased exposure to oestrogen and being a carrier of a BRCA2 mutation. Most MBC is ductal and the majority are oestrogen receptor positive. Modified radical mastectomy is the treatment of choice for local disease and adjuvant radio-, hormonal and chemotherapy should all be considered. Stage for stage, the prognosis for MBC is similar to that for female breast cancer. Despite a wealth of small retrospective studies on MBC, its rarity means there is a lack of prospective randomised controlled treatment trials, which needs to be addressed if significant advances are to be made in the treatment of this unusual and challenging disease.},

The primary objective of this study was to determine which of the common prognostic factors for female breast cancer predict prognosis in MBC. A secondary objective was to assess the impact of comorbid illnesses on survival. A retrospective review of demographic data, surgical treatment, pathological staging, adjuvant treatment and follow-up was completed for 16 patients with MBC (1 intraductal and 15 invasive). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was processed for ploidy, S phase fraction, and immunohistochemical detection of estrogen and progesterone receptors plus expression of p53 and erbB-2 protein. Six of 15 patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma are currently alive without evidence of disease and a median survival of 61 months. Nine patients died after a median survival of 52 months, with 6 patients having no evidence of recurrent breast cancer. Two of 3 deaths secondary to advanced breast cancer occurred in patients who initially presented with T4 lesions and were staged IIIB. Two of 15 tumors were erbB-2 positive, whereas only 1 tested weakly positive for p53 protein. We observed that MBCs express erbB-2 and p53 proteins infrequently. Neither ploidy status, S phase fraction, nor erbB2/p53 status provided any apparent improvement in establishing prognosis beyond routine pathological staging. Advanced TNM stage was associated with diminished survival. The majority of MBCs express estrogen and progesterone receptors. Survivals in MBC were reduced in association with comorbid medical conditions.},

	abstract = {The etiology and pathogenesis of male breast cancer (MBC) are poorly known. This is due to the fact that the disease is rare, and large-scale genetic epidemiologic studies have been difficult to carry out. Here, we studied the frequency of eight recurrent Finnish BRCA2 founder mutations in a large cohort of 154 MBC patients (65% diagnosed in Finland from 1967 to 1996). Founder mutations were detected in 10 patients (6.5%), eight of whom carried the 9346(-2) A>G mutation. Two novel mutations (4075 delGT and 5808 del5) were discovered in a screening of the entire BRCA2 coding region in 34 samples. However, these mutations were not found in the rest of the 120 patients studied. Patients with positive family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer were often BRCA2 mutation carriers (44%), whereas those with no family history showed a low frequency of involvement (3.6%; P < .0001). Finally, we found only one Finnish MBC patient with 999 del5, the most common founder mutation in Finnish female breast cancer (FBC) patients, and one that explains most of the hereditary FBC and MBC cases in Iceland. The variation in BRCA2 mutation spectrum between Finnish MBC patients and FBC patients in Finland and breast cancer patients in Iceland suggests that modifying genetic and environmental factors may significantly influence the penetrance of MBC and FBC in individuals carrying germline BRCA2 mutations in some populations.},

It is the aim of this paper to investigate whether men occupationally exposed to gasoline and its combustion products have an elevated risk of breast cancer. Methods: A nationwide register based case control study on male breast cancer morbidity was established among members of a pension fund, compulsory for all employees. Employment histories were reconstructed for each of 230 cases and 12,880 control subjects based on computerized records. The odds ratios, adjusted for socioeconomic status, were estimated by conditional logistic regression analysis. Results: When a lag time of at least 10 years was included, the odds ratio for breast cancer among men with over three months of employment in trades with potential exposure to gasoline and combustion products was 2.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.34.5). Among men younger than 40 years at the time of first employment, the odds ratio was 5.4 (2.4-11.9). Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis that occupational exposure to gasoline vapors and combustion products may play a role in the causation of male breast cancer. This hypothesis warrants further evaluation particularly in women. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

PCR was used to detect LOH at 3 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers spanning BRCA2 region on 13q by comparing the allelic pattern in matched tumor and blood DNA samples. In this study LOH at the BRCA2 locus was observed in 82.6% of informative cases, confirming previous observations on high frequency of LOH affecting the BRCA2 region in male breast cancer. We identified 5 somatic BRCA2 mutations in a set of 23 sporadic male breast cancers (21%). Two silent and I missense alterations were novel BRCA2 variants. Here we also report first somatic frameshift BRCA2 mutation in male breast cancer 8138del5. In 3 tumors with somatic BRCA2 alterations, I missense, I silent and frameshift LOH at chromosome 13q12-13 were detected and losses involved a wild-type allele of BRCA2 gene. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The average age at presentation was 60.7 ± 7.5. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the most frequent histopathological type; lobular carcinoma was detected in only one of our cases. Right-sided male breast carcinoma was seen in 7 of 11 cases, left-sided in four cases. We detected gynaecomastia in two patients. Other factors were excessive alcohol consumption for 35 years in one patient, family history in one patient and exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and light at night in four patients. We demonstrated no risk factor in the other three cases. Of the patients in our study, the youngest was 45 years old - the patient with post-pubertal gynaecomastia. The overall rate of male breast carcinoma seen among people who had worked for the Turkish Institution of Electricity in eastern Turkey was 0.3%. In our study we demonstrated a close relation between exposure to EMFs and light at night and male breast carcinoma in eastern Turkey. We also supposed that not only exposure to EMFs but also the duration of the exposure could affect the risk of development of male breast carcinoma. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

On physical examination, a huge tumor entirely occupied the right breast and extensively had infiltrated the chest wall. Chest X-ray and CT showed massive pleural effusion and multiple small nodular lesions in the lung. Invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast was diagnosed by incisional biopsy, confirming advanced breast cancer with lung metastases and bilateral pleural effusion (T4cN2M1, Stage IV). Because ER and PgR levels were 110 fmol/mg and 190 fmol/mg, respectively, and because his general condition was poor, we selected medical treatment with tamoxifen (TAM). Thirty-two weeks later, the tumor had showed pronounced reduction with scarring. The patient underwent local excision of the scar tissue. The quality of life of the patient was favorably improved and no severe adverse events were observed. The tumor in the chest wall recurred two months after the end of TAM treatment, possibly because the patient did not accept continuous TAM therapy. The patient died from complications of brain metastasis 32 months after the start of TAM treatment. We report a rare case of advanced male breast cancer and on the effectiveness of continuous TAM treatment.},

	abstract = {Background: Mutations in the BRCA2 gene account for the majority of the families with male and female breast cancer cases, and a number of BRCA2 mutations have been reported in males with breast cancer. The aim of this study was to characterise BRCA2 germ-line mutations in Spanish male breast cancer patients. Patients and methods: We screened DNA from 11 affected men and 6 women with breast cancer (BC) who had an affected male relative (father or brother). Exons 2-9 and 12-27 were screened by SSCP, and exons 10 and 11 were screened by PTT. PCR products with a variant band were sequenced. Results: Three BRCA2 frameshift mutations were identified (17.6%): the 3374delA in codon 1049 (exon 11), 6857delAA in codon 2010 (exon 11), and 9254delATCAT in codon 3009 (exon 23). These mutations were present in patients with affected first-degree relatives (3 of 9, 33%). The proportion of male patients with a family history of BC in at least one first-degree relative was 53%. Conclusions: There is an association between BRCA2 mutations and male breast cancer, especially in those with a family history of BC. The high prevalence of BRCA2 mutations among males should be considered when estimating risk for female relatives. All new male cases of BC should be regarded as being possibly inherited and should be fully investigated.},

Seventeen (56.7%) of the 30 cases of MBC were bcl-2 positive. Few specimens were found positive for c-erbB-2 (6.7%) and p53 (6.7%). The 5-year survival rate was marginally better for those patients with tumors staining positively for bcl-2 (p = 0.05). It was impossible to estimate the association between survival rate and p53 and c-erbB-2 expression because of the small number of positively stained specimens. In this study, only bcl-2 showed marginal association to other tumor parameters and a trend toward a better 5-year survival rate. At present there is inadequate evidence to support the use of molecular markers as independent prognostic markers in MBC.},

In the present study, we have comprehensively screened the entire coding region of the AR gene for mutations and also studied the role of AR CAG and GGC repeat lengths as risk factors for MBC in a cohort of 32 Finnish MBC patients. To estimate the possible involvement of the prostate cancer predisposing AR Arg726Leu germ-line mutation in MBC, this mutation was tested in 117 MBC patients. No germ-line mutations were found and the CAG and GGC repeat lengths were similar among MBC cases as among Scandinavian population. Our data indicate that the AR gene does not substantially contribute to MBC predisposition.},

The goal of this retrospective study is to analyse the epidemiologic, clinic, therapeutic and evolutive profiles of this disease in 71 cases collected at the National Institute of Oncology in Rabat, Morocco, between the years 1985 and 1998. The median age was 60 years. No significant risk factor was found. The average consultation's delay was 35 months. The main clinical complaint was a mass beneath the areola in 86% of the cases, associated with ulceration in 18% of the cases. For that, the disease was diagnosed at an advanced stage. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the most frequent pathologic type (91.5% of cases). Management consisted especially of radical mastectomy, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and hormonal therapy with or without chemotherapy. It was possible to follow 58 of the patients. The median of follow-up was 30 months. The evolution has been characterized by local recurrence, after a median delay of 36 months, in five cases (8.5% of all patients). Metastasis occurred, after a median delay of 12 months, in 14 cases (24% of all patients). The site of metastasis was the bone in six cases, lung in five cases, liver in one case, liver and skin in one case and pleura and skin in one case. There were three cases of death. In one case, death was related to lung metastases. In the two remaining cases, death was due to comorbid disease. Progression was observed in one case. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To determine retrospectively the outcome of postoperative radiation therapy in male breast cancer. Local/distant control was assessed with attention to age, stage, lymph node involvement, histopathological differentiation and hormone receptor status.Materials and methods: Thirty-one male patients were irradiated postoperatively at the chest wall (mean dose 50 Gy) and 16 patients received radiation to regional lymph nodes. Tumour distribution by stage was: stage 0 (9.7%), stage I (22.6%), stage II (32.2%) and stage III (35.5%). Nine patients were subjected to additional hormone therapy and three patients to chemotherapy.Results: Local control was achieved in 30/31 (96.8%) patients. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival (OS), disease specific (DSS) and disease free survival (DFS) at 5 years were 77% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.93), 84% (CI, 0.69-0.98) and 73% (CI, 0.57-0.91), respectively. Five-year DFS for stage 0+I, II and III was 100, 56.3 and 67.3%, respectively. Favourable results were observed in patients with negative axillary nodes with 5-year OS/DFS of 90.9% (CI, 0.74-1.0). For lymph node positive patients DFS was 71% (CI, 0.4-1.0). Patients who presented lymph node metastases with extracapsular extension the 5-year OS was 80% (CI, 0.45-1.00), but the DFS was 0%. Stage of disease, lymph node involvement and histological differentiation were found to have statistically significant influence on DFS, but not on OS.Conclusion: Application of postoperative radiotherapy approved in females resulted in one local relapse in our study population. Other treatment modalities (hormone therapy/chemotherapy) should continue to be considered a necessary treatment option for appropriately selected patients.

	abstract = {Aims. To carry out a retrospective study of male breast cancer over a 22-year experience. Methods. Data from 121 male patients with breast cancer treated between the years 1972 and 1994 at the Surgical Clinic of Ankara Oncology Hospital were reviewed. Distribution of cases according to stage was: 2.5% stage I, 28.9% stage II, 55.4% stage III and 13.2% stage IV (AJCC staging method). The surgical treatment for 23 of the patients (19%) was Halsted's radical mastectomy or modified radical mastectomy. Seventy-three cases (60.3%) had total mastectomy without axillary node dissection and 25 (20.7%) had local tumour excision only. Seventy-two of 121 patients had adjuvant treatment. Results. In general the prognosis of men with breast cancer was worse than for women. In the analysis of patients in stages I, II and III-A (operable disease group), the 5-year survival rates were 73% in axillary node-negative patients and 77% in those with tumours sized under 5 cm (P < 0.001). In these patients, univariate analysis demonstrated that axillary status (relative risk of death in positive status vs. negative = 3.6), tumour size (relative risk in T3 vs. T(1 + 2) = 2), surgical treatment type (relative risk in simple mastectomy vs. radical mastectomy = 1.9 and adjuvant chemotherapy (relative risk if no chemotherapy = 1.4) were statistically significant factors associated with survival. Conclusions. Cox's regression model revealed that axillary status, tumour size and type of surgical treatment were the most important independent prognostic factors (P < 0.001).},

	abstract = {Background: Lysozyme, one of the major protein components of human milk that is also synthesized by a significant percentage of breast carcinomas, is associated with lesions that have a favorable outcome in female breast cancer. Here we evaluate the expression and prognostic value of lysozyme in male breast cancer (MBC). Methods: Lysozyme expression was examined by immunohistochemical methods in a series of 60 MBC tissue sections and in 15 patients with gynecomastia. Staining was quantified using the HSCORE (histological score) system, which considers both the intensity and the percentage of cells staining at each intensity. Prognostic value of lysozyme was retrospectively evaluated by multivariate analysis taking into account conventional prognostic factors. Results: Lysozyme immunostaining was negative in all cases of gynecomastia. A total of 27 of 60 MBC sections (45%) stained positively for this protein, but there were clear differences among them with regard to the intensity and percentage of stained cells. Statistical analysis showed that lysozyme HSCORE values in relation to age, tumor size, nodal status, histological grade, estrogen receptor status, metastasis and histological type did not increase the statistical significance. Univariate analysis confirmed that both nodal involvement and lysozyme values were significant predictors of short-term relapse-free survival. Multivariate analysis, according to Cox's regression model, also showed that nodal status and lysozyme levels were significant independent indicators of short-term relapse-free survival. Conclusion: Tumor expression of lysozyme is associated with lesions that have an unfavorable outcome in male breast cancer. This milk protein may be a new prognostic factor in patients with breast cancer. © 2002 Serra et al.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: p53, c-erbB-2, and tumor microvascular density have been shown to be potential prognostic tools in female breast cancer. Our objective was to assess the significance of these biomarkers as prognostic factors in infiltrating male breast cancer. Methods: A resrospective study of expression of p53, c-erbB-2, and tumor microvascular density was done on a group of 26 male breast cancer patients. Biotin-streptavidin immunohistochemical study with specific anti-p53, anti-c-erbB-2, and anti-CD34 antibodies was carried out on paraffin sections of breast carcinoma. The data of expression of the biomarkers were merged with clinicopathological data such as tumor grade, T class, TNM stage, estrogen receptor status, tumor recurrence, and patient survival. Results: p53 and c-erbB-2 were expressed in 46% and 39% of carcinomas, respectively. No correlation was found between positive immunoreactivity of p53, and tumor grade, size, T class, TNM stage, and survival. Nor was any relation found between tumor size, T class, TNM stage, survival, and c-erbB-2 overexpression. c-erbB-2 overexpression was significantly higher in high grade carcinomas. Estrogen receptor (ER) were positive in 21 out of 26 of tumors (81%). No trends were observed between estrogen receptor status and clinicopathological parameters or survival (data not shown). There was a positive correlation between mean mircovascular density (MVD), advanced T class, and survival: higher MVD counts were found in patients with advanced tumors and in those who had tumor relapses or died of metastatic disease. Conclusions: This study suggests that tumor microvascular density may serve as a potential prognostic tool in male breast carcinoma. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The role of HER-2/neu in male breast cancer is not well defined. The purpose of the current study was to measure the frequency of HER-2/neu expression in primary male breast cancer, to demonstrate HER-2/neu gene amplification in cases found to be positive for protein overexpression, and to correlate HER-2/neu positivity with clinicopathological variables. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival material from 99 primary male breast carcinomas was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the HercepTest™ (DAKO Corp., Hamburg, Germany). Scoring was performed according to established guidelines. All cases demonstrating HER-2/neu staining by IHC (1+/2+ and 3+) were analyzed for HER-2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) utilizing the PathVysion™ assay (Vysis Corp., Downers Grove, Illinois) to assess HER-2/neu amplification status. The immunohistochemical staining of the HER-2/neu protein revealed HER-2/neu positivity in 15/99 (15.1%) cases, eight tumors showed 2+ and 7 tumors 3+ staining. HER-2/neu gene amplification was observed in 11/99 cases (11,1%), and all of the 3+ and 4/8 from the 2+ cases were amplified. HER-2/neu gene amplification/protein overexpression did not correlate with tumor state, histological grade or estrogen/progesterone receptor status nor the axillary lymph node status. This is the first comprehensive study of HER-2/neu gene amplification by FISH analysis in primary male breast cancer. Compared to female primary breast cancer the percentage of HER-2/neu positivity in our study was lower. Our data provide first evidence for HER-2/neu gene amplification in male breast cancer. Further studies should be addressed on the potential application of the monoclonal rhuMAB HER-2/neu antibody for treatment of HER-2/neu positive male breast cancer.},

Although no germ-line BRCA1 mutation was observed, 6 of the 18 male breast cancer cases (33%) carried truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Unexpectedly, none of them reported a family history for breast/ovarian cancer. Four of six truncating mutations were novel, and two mutations were recurrent. Four patients (22%) had a family history of breast/ovarian cancer in at least one first- or second- degree relative; however, no BRCA2 mutation was identified among them. No mutation was identified in either of the genes in the gynecomastias. These results provide evidence for a strong genetic component of male breast cancer in Hungary.},

	abstract = {Due to the low incidence of breast cancer in males them are not many reports in the literature. In this study we analyzed results of treatment in 65 breast cancer males, who had been treated in one institution. Radical surgery was performed in 45 patients. Lymph node metastases were found in 25 patients (55.5%), the tumor was usually moderately differentiated (21 pts - 46.7%). Median survival after radical surgery was 73 months compared to 38 months for nonsurgical patients (p < 0.0001). In the group of males after radical surgery the results of 5-, 10- and 15-year survival rates were 69.8, 59.7 and 31.3% respectively. Comparable analysis of two subgroups of patients with favorable (TI or T2, N0, grade I or II) and unfavorable (T3 or N+ or grade III) prognostic factors was also performed. In the first subgroup the 5-, 10- and 15-year survival rates were 90, 77.4 and 62%, compared to 61.8, 23.1 and 23.1% for the second subgroup. The multivariate analysis showed grading and node status as the strongest parameters influencing survival. Relative risk of death was over 3 times higher for nodal metastases and near 3 times higher for high grade carcinomas (p < 0.01), compared to patients without metastases and low grade of tumor. Similar analysis was performed when 45 males were compared to 500 selected women, with similar clinical parameters (age, node status, grading). Again, data indicated grading and lymph node status as the strongest prognostic factors. It was not unlikely, that gender had some influence on prognosis, when relative risk of death for males was over 1.5 times higher than for females, but this result was not clearly significant (p < 0.1). The question, whether male breast cancer prognosis is worse then in female remains open. Multiinstitutional prospective studies are needed in this area.},

	abstract = {We conducted an analysis on 41 cases of male breast cancer (median age 54 y; range 25-82y) in Kuwait. Most (51%) were stage II cancers with 65% arising in the left breast. There were 5 (12%) T1 tumours, 23 (56%) T2 tumours and 13 (32%) T3/T4 tumours. They were mostly (95%) infiltrating ductal carcinomas; 97% were grade 2 or 3. Axillary lymph node involvement was found in 69%. Estimated 5-year survival rates were 67% and 58% for overall and relapse free survival respectively. Favourable prognosis was associated with age below 50 y, clinical stage I and II, small tumour size (T1, T2), low tumour grade and absence of nodal involvement or distant metastases; nodal status and grade were independent factors for relapse free survival in multivariate analysis. In 18 cases, an immunohistochemical study showed some degree of tumour antigen reaction for ER in 89% of cases, PR in 61%, pS2 in 44%, CathD in 72%, p53 in 56%, c-erbB-2 in 50%, Ki67 and PCNA in 100% and bcl-2 in 78%. There were significant associations between several of these factors but none influenced survival. Despite the high incidence of staining of ER, our data do not support the concept of an endocrine pathway that could be usefully antagonized with antioestrogens for therapeutic benefit, as in women. © 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is emerging as an alternative to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for many female breast cancer patients. In contrast, ALND remains the standard of care tor male breast patients with similar tumors. We evaluated the results of SLNB in male breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillas. METHODS: The patient population consisted of six consecutive male breast cancer patients, ages 44 to 76 years old, treated at our institution. All patients had negative axillas by clinical exam and ultrasound. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was used in all cases. In each patient, 5 cc of isosulfan blue 1% was injected intraoperatively adjacent to the breast tumor or biopsy cavity prior to SLNB. Additionally, Tc-99m sulfur colloid was injected at a dose of 0.5 mCi 4 hours before surgery (2 patients) or 2.5 mCi 24 hours before surgery (4 patients). A gamma probe was used intraoperatively. A SLN was defined as any blue node and/or any node with ex-vivo counts 10x higher than the axillary background. SLNs were assessed intraoperatively by touch prep cytology. Completion ALND was performed in 4 patients. RESULTS: Table 1 summarizes primary tumor characteristics. A mean of 2.2 SLNs per patient was encountered. Lymphoscintigraphy identified SLNs in 4/6 patients preoperatively. Using the gamma probe, SLNs were identified in 5/6 patients. Dye injection identified SLNs in 6/6 patients. Overall, successful SLN localization was accomplished in all cases combining both techniques. Touch prep cytology reports correlated with the final pathological analysis in 6/6 patients. Patients with negative SLNs had no positive nodes in the completion ALND specimens. One patient with a positive SLN had 3 additional positive nodes in the completion ALND specimen. CONCLUSIONS: These data compare favorably with the available literature for SLN biopsy in female breast cancer patients. Blue dye injection and lymphatic mapping were complementary. Performance of SLN biopsy should be considered for the staging of the axilla in male breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillas, SLN biopsy reduces the number of unnecessary ALNDs and could increase the accuracy of the staging of the axilla in these patients.

	abstract = {Background: Males comprise less than 1% of all breast cancer patients. Although the first description of male breast cancer was presented probably five thousand years ago, knowledge about the disease is still limited. Objectives: Clinical characteristics of men with breast cancer operated on in Clinical Department of Surgical Oncology, Medical University of Łódź. Analysis of clinical and pathological features of male breast cancer, presentation of treatment mode. Material and methods: From 1st January 1977 to 31st March 2000, in the Clinical Department of Surgical Oncology, Medical University of Łódź, 3862 patients were operated on for breast cancer. There were 24 males among them (0.6%). Clinical and pathological data were obtained retrospectively form the charts of 22 patients. Results: Age of patients ranged from 26 to 86 years; mean 60.0 years. Mean duration of symptoms before the first visit to oncologist was 27.5 months. In all cases the presence of suspicious lesion was found in physical examination. Diameter of primary tumor (evaluated clinically) ranged from 0.5 cm to 8 cm; mean 3.6 cm. In majority of patients primary tumor was located centrally in retroareolar region. Axillary lymph nodes were palpable in 13 males (59.1 %). In all patients mastectomy was performed. Ductal cancer was recognised in all males in pathological examination. Presence of metastases in axillary lymph nodes was observed in 13 patients (59.1%). 13 patients received adjuvant treatment (59.1%): 5 - chemotherapy (CMF) (22.7%), 3 - radiotherapy (13.6%), the remaining 5 patients (22.7%) - combined treatment (chemotherapy + radiotherapy + hormonal therapy). Mean follow-up was 42.2 months (median 25.5 months). Actuarial mean survival was 54.5 months. Probability of 5-year survival was 67%. Conclusion: Male breast cancer is a rare disease. Our studies revealed that duration of symptoms before a visit to oncologist was very long and therefore the cancers were at advanced stage on initial examination. Treatment of choice should comprise modified radical mastectomy and radiotherapy, chemotherapy as well as hormonotherapy if indicated. It seems that increase of public awareness as well as increase of physicians' knowledge of male breast cancer may allow for earlier detection and treatment of that disease.},

	abstract = {41 breast cancer or breast-ovarian cancer families, including 12 families with at least one affected first-degree male relative, were screened for mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Mutations had not been found in the BRCA1 gene of these families. Chemical cleavage of Mismatch was used to identify nucleotide changes within large PCR products (average size 1.2 kb) that carried strand-specific fluorescent end-labels. 15 amplicons were sufficient to scan 18 exons, including the large exon 11. The remaining 9 small exons were examined by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. The high sensitivity of this approach was documented by the detection, in these 41 patients, of all 9 exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms reported with heterozygosity >0.1. Truncating BRCA2 mutations were found in 7 of the 41 families. 3 of them were in the group of 12 families comprising cases of male breast cancer. Since the methods used here have no bias for particular types of mutations, these data confirm the high proportion of frameshifts among mutations in BRCA2. However, relevant single nucleotide substitutions were also found: one resulting in a stop codon and another one, present in a male patient, was the previously reported change Asp2723His, that affects a highly conserved region of the BRCA2 protein. This study indicates a BRCA2 contribution of 10% (95% CI 2.5-17.5) to our original cohort of 59 breast-ovarian cancer families, whereas the contribution of BRCA1 had been estimated at 46% (95% CI 33-59). © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign.},

Allelic imbalance, reflected by change in microsatellite repeat number (MSI) or loss of heterozygosity (LOH), is thought to play an important role in carcinogenesis. In this study we have examined DNA extracted from paraffin tissue from 15 patients treated for male breast cancer, for evidence of such abnormalities, at 20 different loci across the genome. Polymerase chain reaction amplified products of normal and tumor DNA pairs were compared by electrophoresis on Spreadex gels. MSI was detected in 5 patients; at a single site in 2 cases and at 3, 7 and 9 sites in another 3 cases. LOH was seen in 8 cases (53%); at more than one site in 4 of these. Two patients had allelic variation at 56 and 62% of assessable sites. The most unstable loci were D2S441 (33%) and D13S325 (27%). These observations indicate that replication errors and allelic loss characterise male breast cancer tissue in much the same way as they do in women. More studies will be needed to establish whether these are random lesions or whether there are specifically affected sites that occur in both male and female breast cancer.},

Here we screened 15 Turkish breast and breast-ovarian cancer families for mutations in both genes by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) and the protein truncation test (PTT), followed by DNA sequencing. Three families included a male breast cancer case, one without family history. Three germline mutations were identified, two in BRCA1 and one in BRCA2. The two BRCA1 mutations, 5382insC and 5622C → T, were found in breast-ovarian cancer families. The BRCA2 3414delTCAG is a novel mutation detected in a site-specific breast cancer family that included 1 case of male breast cancer. These first results of Turkish families show that the frequency of germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations appears to be high in families with at least 3 breast and/or ovarian cancer cases.},

	abstract = {The concept of sentinel node biopsy has been validated for female breast cancer patients whereas, ALND remains the standard of care for male breast cancer patients with similar tumours. We evaluated the results of SLN biopsy in male breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillae. This study included all male breast cancer patients who underwent SLN biopsy between February 1998 and October 2003. All patients had negative axillae on clinical examination. All patients underwent pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy. SLN biopsy was performed using a combination of Patent blue V and 99mTc-radiolabelled colloidal albumin injected peritumourally. Nine patients, 26-79 years of age, were included in the study. Pre-operative lymphoscinitgraphy identified SLNs in all patients. Intraoperatively, SLNs were successfully localised in all patients. The mean number of SLNs encountered was 2.4. Five patients had a positive SLN, four a negative SLN. Five patients (one with a negative SLN, four with a positive SLN) had been elected pre-operatively to undergo ALND regardless of findings on SLN biopsy. ALND confirmed the SLN to be negative in one patient (false-negative rate: 0%) and three of the four patients with positive SLN(s) had additional positive nodes in the axilla. SLN biopsy accurately predicted axillary lymph node status in these five patients. These findings compare favourably with findings reported in the literature regarding SLN biopsy in female breast cancer patients. SLN biopsy accurately staged the axilla in male breast cancer patients and should be considered for axillary staging in male breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillae. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Purpose: Evaluation of second primary cancers provides valuable insight about etiology and shared risk factors. Studies of second primary cancers following prostate cancer conclude that overall risk of second primary cancers decreases. However, risk of bladder cancer and kidney cancer increases. We examine the risk of common and rare second primary cancers following prostate cancer in a large population based cohort to identify possible common etiological factors. Materials and Methods: All prostate cancer cases in the Swedish Cancer Registry (135, 713) from 1958 to the end of 1996 constituted the study base. Risk (standardized incidence ratio) of second primary cancers was calculated as the ratio between observed and expected number of cancers. We used 2-tailed 95% confidence intervals (CI) to test significance. Results: An overall increased risk (standardized incidence ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.15-1.19) of second primary cancers was found but was only seen in the first 6 months of followup (ratio 3.45, 3.32-3.57). The most interesting finding was an increased risk (ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.44-2.74) of male breast cancer. Other tumor sites with increased risk were the small intestine (standardized incidence ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.09-1.51), skin melanoma (ratio 1.33, 95% CI 1.16-1.51) and endocrine tumors (ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.13-1.74). Conclusions: A small but increased risk of second primary cancers following prostate cancer was found, most likely due to increased surveillance during the first 6 months after diagnosis. However, following prostate cancer there is an increased risk of endocrine related second primary cancers such as male breast cancer and carcinoids in the small intestine. To our knowledge these associations have not been reported previously, and they warrant more study.},

In the current study, patients affected with male breast cancer treated in the last decade with a multidisciplinary approach were reported from a single Institution. Fifty-five patients with male breast cancer treated between 1990 and 1998 were included in this study. The median follow-up period was 36 months. Five-year disease-free and overall survival were 44.5% and 72.9%, respectively. Patients' age, tumor size, axillary status, tumor type and treatment modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonotherapy were evaluated as possible prognostic factors affecting the disease-free and overall survival periods. In univariate analysis, tumor size, axillary status and extent of surgery were found to be affecting overall survival significantly whereas axillary status, tumor type, extent of surgery and chemotherapy affected disease-free survival. In multivariate analysis, axillary status, extent of surgery and tumor type were found as independent prognostic factors for overall survival and radiotherapy was added to these factors for disease-free survival. In conclusion, the approach to male breast cancer patients should be similar to that for female patients. Modified radical mastectomy should be the gold standard followed by combined adjuvant therapy individualized for patients due to axillary status, tumor size and type.},

	abstract = {Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is rapidly emerging as an alternative to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for many female breast cancer patients. In contrast, ALND remains the standard of care for male breast cancer patients with similar tumors. We evaluated the results of SLN biopsy in male breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillae. This study included all male breast cancer patients who underwent SLN biopsy at our institution between October 1999 and 2000. All patients had negative axillae on clinical examination and sonography. All patients underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy followed by SLN biopsy performed using a combination of isosulfan blue dye and technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid. Tc 99m sulfur colloid was injected at a dose of 2.5 mCi 24 h before surgery (four patients) or 0.5 mCi 2-4 h before surgery (three patients). Intraoperatively, 5 ml of 1% isosulfan blue was injected adjacent to the breast tumor or biopsy cavity prior to SLN biopsy. A gamma probe was used intraoperatively in order to localize SLNs. Any node that was blue or associated with ex vivo radioactivity counts at least 10 times higher than the axillary background counts was defined as a SLN. SLNs were assessed intraoperatively using touch preparation cytologic examination. Completion ALND was performed if nodal metastases were identified. Seven patients, 44-76 years of age, were included in the study. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy identified SLNs in five patients. Intraoperatively, SLNs were identified in all seven patients. SLNs were identified in six patients using the gamma probe and in all seven patients using blue dye. The mean number of SLNs encountered was 2.9. Findings on touch preparation cytology correlated with findings on the final pathological analysis examination in all patients. One patient had a positive SLN, this patient had three additional positive nodes identified in his completion ALND specimen. Three patients with negative SLNs had been elected preoperatively to undergo ALND regardless of findings on SLN biopsy, no positive lymph nodes were identified in the ALND specimens from these patients. These findings compare favorably with findings reported in the literature regarding SLN biopsy in female breast cancer patients. Blue dye injection and radioisotope injection were complementary. SLN biopsy should be considered for axillary staging in male breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillae.},

The most common presenting symptom was a painless lump. The mean age at the initial diagnosis was 63 (range 51-83) years. Tumor stage distribution was as follows: stage I, four patients; stage II nine patients; and stage III, one patient. The most common location of the tumor in the breast was central. The median tumor size was 3.8 cm. The most common histologic type was infiltrating ductal carcinoma (n=12). The patients underwent primary surgery (n=13) and adjuvant radiotherapy. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 115 (median 44) months. The increasing tumor size and axillary lymph node metastases have a negative impact on overall survival. In most cases, the natural history of male breast cancer is similar to that of the breast carcinoma in women.

	abstract = {Objective: Breast cancer is a rare disease in men, and knowledge relevant to male breast cancer is still limited. This paper reports our experience with this disease during a 13-year period at Mackay Memorial Hospital. Patients and Methods: From 1987 to 2000, 13 men with primary breast carcinoma were treated at the Department of General Surgery. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical and pathological data, as extracted from hospital admission and discharge summaries, progress notes, operative notes, laboratory reports, and pathology reports. Both demographic characteristics and tumor-associated factors were noted. Staging was carried out according to the guidelines of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC, 1992), as used in women with breast cancer. Results: Six of the 13 patients are currently alive without evidence of disease, while 4 of 13 died with a median survival of 44 months. Exclusively, death was due to other medical conditions (2 upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 1 acute myocardial infarction). In our series, the 5-year disease free survival is zero for stage III & IV, 33% for stage II, 100% for stage I & 0. Conclusions: As in women, advanced TNM stage was associated with diminished survival. However, male breast cancer differs biologically from female breast cancer, with a higher incidence of estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity. Sixty nine percent of our patients had a positive expression. Adjuvant hormonal or chemotherapy, or both, is based largely on the benefits observed in clinical trials in women with breast cancer, but optimal treatment protocols in males are unknown. Further research is needed in male breast cancer to develop optimal treatment strategies.},

The numbers of incidence and the crude incidence rates for male breast cancer have increased during the last 3 decades, while the age-standardized rates have remained constant. The age-specific incidence rates for males showed a gradual increase with age, while those for females showed a steep increase beginning at twenty years of age and a peak around 45-49 or 50-54 years old. The age-standardized incidence rates of male breast cancer were lower in Japan than in European countries and North America, as were those of female breast cancer. Distributions of the histological type and the extent of disease were not significantly different between males and females. Relative 5-year survival for the male breast cancer was, however, lower than that for the female, especially in the "regional" stage and "distant" stage.

	abstract = {The genetic changes underlying the development and progression of male breast cancer are poorly understood. Germline BRCA2 mutations account for a significant part of male breast cancer, but the majority of patients lack a known inherited predisposition. We recently demonstrated that the progression of breast cancer in female carriers of a germline BRCA I or BRCA2 mutation follows specific genetic pathways, distinct from each other and from sporadic breast cancer. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide survey by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of somatic genetic aberrations in 26 male breast cancers, including five tumors from BRCA2 mutation carriers. BRCA2 tumors exhibited a significantly higher number of chromosomal aberrations than sporadic tumors. The most common alterations in sporadic male breast cancer were +1q (38%), +8q (33%), +17q (33%), -13q (29%), and - 8p (24%). In tumors from BRCA2 mutation carriers, the five most common genetic changes were +8q (100%), +20q (100%), +17q (80%), -13q (80%), and - 6q (60%). The CGH results in these two groups of male breast cancers are almost identical to those identified in the corresponding sporadic and BRCA2- associated female breast cancers. The results suggest that despite substantial hormonal differences between females and males, similar genetic changes are selected for during tumor progression. Furthermore, the presence of a highly penetrant germline BRCA2 mutation apparently leads to a characteristic somatic tumor progression pathway, again shared between affected male and female mutation carriers.},

We determined the cytosolic levels of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), cathepsin D, pS2-protein, uPA, uPAR, PAI-1 and PAI-2 of the primary tumour tissues from 40 male breast cancer patients. The tumour levels were compared with those of 180 matched females and 4114 historic females with breast cancer. In male breast tumours the level of PgR was higher, those of uPA, PAI-1, PAI-2 and cathepsin D lower. The tumour level of ER in men was similar to those in the matched and postmenopausal women, but much higher than those in the historic women. Male breast cancer seems to be biologically different from female breast cancer. Correlation of the eight cell biologic factors with disease outcome showed that PAI-1 (p = 0.03) was the only independent predictive factor for poor prognosis in male breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a rare disease in men, affecting less than 0.1% of the male population. Two heritable gene defects have been associated with a predisposition to male breast cancer development, i.e., germ-line mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 and the androgen receptor (AR) gene. In this study, the entire coding regions of BRCA2 and AR were screened for mutations in 34 consecutive male breast cancer patients. Five different truncating BRCA2 mutations were identified in 7 (21%) of the 34 cases, with all mutations being of germ-line origin. Three of the mutated cases carried the same mutation (4186delG), which has been found earlier in two Swedish families with multiple female breast cancer cases. Haplotype analysis supported a common ancestry of 4186delG. One mutation, 6503delTT, was found in a male carrying also a previously identified COOH-terminal polymorphic stop codon (Lys3326ter). No differences were seen between mutation carriers and noncarriers with respect to clinical stage and estrogen or progesterone receptor status. Mutation carriers tended to be younger at diagnosis. No germ-line AR mutations were found in the present material, but the number of AR polyglutamine repeats tended to be lower among mutation carriers. Most surprisingly, only one of the seven BRCA2 mutation carriers had a positive family history of breast cancer, suggesting a lower penetrance of some BRCA2 mutations or an influence of modifying factors for disease development in males and females. The present study implies that approximately one-fifth of all male breast cancer cases in the Swedish population are due to germ-line BRCA2 mutations.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Previous studies of male breast cancer have suggested that due to the lack of breast tissue, post-mastectomy radiation should be routinely utilized in all stages of this disease. We propose that the pattern of local recurrence in male breast cancer is, stage for stage, similar to female breast cancer and, therefore, the indications for post-mastectomy radiation should be similar. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 44 cases of male breast cancer from 1967 to 1995. Primary therapy was surgical in all cases and 13 patients received postoperative radiation. Results: Tumor, Nodal, Metastasis (TNM) classification revealed 34 Stages I/II and ten Stage III cases. The 5-year overall survival was 75% and the 5-year local recurrence free survival was 70% for the entire group. In patients with Stages I/II disease, 28/34 underwent surgery alone, of whom, at 5-year follow up, only one suffered an isolated local-regional recurrence (3.5%) and one distant failure (3.5%). Of the ten patients with Stage III disease, three underwent surgery alone and none suffered a local failure. While the crude rate of local recurrence (local recurrence at any time in relation to distant failure) for all patients as a whole was 11%, the isolated local recurrence rate (before distant failure) was seen in only 6%, and only 3% amongst those with Stages I/II disease treated with surgery alone. Conclusion: Although postoperative radiation is often routinely utilized in all stages of male breast cancer to help decrease the risk of local recurrence, this review suggests that this risk is small, especially in early stage disease, and, therefore, the same indications for post-mastectomy radiation that apply to female breast cancer, should be utilized in males. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {Objective - To investigate whether risk of male breast cancer is associated with workplace exposures. Methods - A case-control study of 178 cases of male breast cancer and 1041 controls was carried out with data from the United States national mortality followback survey, which collected questionnaire information from proxy respondents of a 1% sample of all 1986 United States deaths among subjects aged 25-74 years. Occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields, high temperatures, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), herbicides, other pesticides, and organic solvents was assessed by applying job-exposure matrices, based on the 1980 United States census occupation and industry codes, to the longest job held by study subjects as reported by the informants. A socioeconomic status index was created by combining information on annual family income, education, assets, and occupation to assess the association of socioeconomic status with male breast cancer. Relative risks were derived from logistic regression modelling, which included age, socioeconomic status, marital status, and body mass index, as well as occupational exposures. Results - Risk of male breast cancer increased significantly with increasing socioeconomic status index (test for trend: p < 0.01), but the risks associated with individual socioeconomic status variables were smaller and the trends were not significant. A significant increase in risk of male breast cancer was associated with employment in blast furnaces, steel works, and rolling mills (odds ratio (OR) 3.4; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1 to 10.1, based on six cases), and motor vehicle manufacturing (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.2 to 8.2, based on seven cases). However, exposures to electromagnetic fields, high temperature, PAHs, herbicides, other pesticides, and organic solvents were not associated with risk of male breast cancer. Conclusions - The role of workplace exposures in increasing risk of breast cancer among men employed in motor vehicle manufacturing and in blast furnaces, steel works, and rolling mills deserves further investigation. The finding on socioeconomic status suggests that, as well as reproductive factors, other lifestyle factors such as diet that may be related to high socioeconomic status in men should be investigated further.},

	abstract = {Background: Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a protein component of the human plasma lipid transport system which is present in benign and malignant human breast tissues. This study analysed the expression of Apo D in men with gynaecomastia or breast cancer, and evaluated its use as a prognostic marker in breast cancer. Methods: Immunohistochemical expression of ApoD was examined in specimens from 15 men with gynaecomastia, two with in situ breast carcinoma and 68 with invasive male breast cancer. Median follow-up in patients with breast cancer was 44 months. Results: All gynaecomastia specimens, both in situ carcinomas and 57 invasive carcinomas (84 per cent) stained positively for Apo D. Apo D values were significantly correlated with axillary node involvement and histological grade of the tumours. In men with breast cancer' univariate analysis showed a statistical association between node status and ApoD content with relapse-free survival (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P < 0.05). Cox multivariate analysis showed that Apo D was a significant indicator of relapse-free survival (P = 0.0089), but node status was the strongest factor able to predict both relapse-free (P = 0.0336) and overall (P = 0.0346) survival. Conclusion: Apo D was expressed in gynaecomastia and a high percentage of male breast carcinomas. There was a positive association of Apo D content in male breast tumours with favourable outcome. Apo D expression was a significant independent indicator of relapse-free survival in male breast cancer.},

	abstract = {To investigate at the population level the impact of BRCA1/BRCA2 gene alterations in male breast cancer, we analyzed a population-based series of 25 male breast cancer cases from Florence, Central Italy. We combined mutational screening with the study of germ-line allele transcript levels and of tumor-associated losses of heterozygosity. Screening by protein truncation test and single-strand conformational polymorphism assay, followed by sequencing, revealed 4 pathogenetic mutations (4 of 25 = 16%; 95% confidence interval, 5-37%), 1 in BRCA1 and 3 in BRCA2, including mutations recurring in Central Italy (BRCA1 3345delAG and BRCA2 6696delTC). The a priori probability of carrying a mutation, estimated using BRCAPRO software, showed a good agreement between expected and observed mutations (14% versus 16%). A 7-fold association between germ-line mutations and family history of breast-ovarian cancer emerged. To investigate associations between BRCA1/BRCA2 status and clinicopathological characteristics, we analyzed the histopathological and immunophenotypic parameters of the tumors. A significant association emerged between mutation carrier status and high histological grade (P = 0.02). Furthermore, one BRCA2 carrier was affected with Paget's disease, an extremely rare male breast cancer histotype. Overall, BRCA1/2 mutations were observed to be strongly associated with positive c-erbB-2 immunostaining (P = 0.004). To evaluate germ-line allele expression, we used primer extension assays targeting frequent BRCA1 and BRCA2 polymorphisms. A BRCA2 allele transcript imbalance was found in one of four heterozygotes tested, all of them negative for germ-line mutations. BRCA1 transcript imbalances were not detected in nine heterozygotes analyzed. Losses of heterozygosity at one or more of nine loci in the BRCA2 region were found in 8 of 22 tumors tested. Interestingly, a case that was negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 germ-line mutations and that had a priori mutation probability <10% showed loss of heterozygosity at all three of the intragenic BRCA2 markers analyzed, which could be related to a somatic involvement of BRCA2. No losses of heterozygosity were detected at BRCA1. In conclusion, constitutional BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations accounted for 16% of the male breast cancer cases in this area of Central Italy. The detection of a BRCA2 germ-line transcript imbalance and of a somatic loss of BRCA2 among the cases that resulted negative for germ-line mutations suggests a role of this gene more relevant than indicated by conventional mutational analysis. A distinct pattern of characteristics indicative of aggressive behavior, including high-grade and c-erbB-2 expression, was evident in tumors from germline BRCA2 mutation carriers. This suggests that phenotypic characteristics may contribute to the identification of hereditary BRCA2-related male breast cancers and that these tumors might share a unique molecular pathway of cancer progression.},

The immunohistochemistry staining for AFP revealed positive reactivity in breast cancer cells, but was negative in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of breast cancer exhibiting immunohistochemically positive AFP in breast cancer cells. In the present case, ConA binding test was useful for identification of the source of AFP production.

	abstract = {Objective. To determine if male breast carcinogenesis was similar to its more common female counterpart, we compared incidence patterns among men and women with breast cancer. Methods. Breast cancer records were obtained from the SEER database. Women were stratified by age <50 and ≥50 years to simulate premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer. Results. Age-adjusted incidence trends were stable among men but increased among women. Male to female breast cancer ratio was higher for blacks than for whites. Favorable prognostic factors reflective of tumor biology (nuclear grade and hormone receptor expression) were more common for men and postmenopausal women than for premenopausal women. For example, low nuclear grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive expression were more common among men and postmenopausal women than among premenopausal women. The age-specific incidence rate curve for men increased steadily for all ages with a constant slope. On the other hand, age-specific rates for women increased rapidly until age 50 years then rose at a slower rate for postmenopausal women. Age-frequency distribution for male breast cancer was unimodal, with peak incidence at age 71 years. Age-frequency distribution for women was bimodal with early-onset and late-onset incidence at 52 and 71 years, respectively. Conclusions. Gender-specific incidence trends differed, most likely reflective of female-related changes in surveillance and/or reproductive risk factors. On the other hand, similar prognostic factor profiles reflective of tumor biology, age-specific incidence rate patterns, and age-frequency distributions suggested that male breast cancer was more like postmenopausal than premenopausal female breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Genetic risk factors for male breast cancer (MBC) are poorly understood. High penetrance genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 account for only a small proportion of the disease. A 1100delC mutation in CHEK2 (previously known as CHK2), a cell-cycle checkpoint kinase, has been implicated in predisposition of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and breast cancer in families suggestive of LFS. This 1100delC mutation has also been shown to confer a 2-fold increase of breast cancer risk in women and a 10-fold increase of risk in men. It was estimated to account for 1% of breast cancers in women and as much as 9% of breast cancers in men at the population level based on analysis of breast cancer families without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. We wanted to evaluate the significance of CHEK2 1100delC in predisposition to MBC by assessing its frequency in a population-based material of 114 Finnish MBC patients. Two patients (1.8%) carried the 1100delC mutation. The mutation frequency among MBC cases was similar to that seen in population controls (26/1885, 1.4%). Our results indicate that CHEK2 1100delC variant does not substantially increase the risk of male breast cancer at the population level. We cannot exclude the fact that a small fraction of hereditary, family-positive male breast cancers could be attributable to CHEK2 mutations. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer susceptibility genes are responsible for most of the hereditary breast cancers. Mutations in BRCA1 account for up to 40-50% of families with hereditary breast cancer only. Mutations in BRCA2 are linked to the other half of inherited breast cancer families and also to male breast cancer. On the contrary, no sporadic breast tumors have been shown to harbor mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. It seems that altered expressions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may contribute to breast cancer development. Moreover, BRCA1 and BRCA2 expressions are regulated in human breast cancer cell lines by estrogen. We addressed the issue of BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression in male breast cancers and gynecomastias. We investigated the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in male breast specimens by immunohistochemical analysis with a panel of antibodies elicited against BRCA1 and BRCA2. The specificity of each antibody has been verified by Western blotting in cell lines from different origins. The characterization of 6 anti-BRCA1 antibodies revealed a BRCA1 220-kDa protein detected in breast cell lines (MDA-MB 231, HBL 100, T-47D and MCF7) or in an acute leukemia (MOLT 4), known to overexpress BRCA1. All 5 anti-BRCA2 antibodies detected a BRCA2 384-kDa protein in the HBL100 and MCF7 breast cell lines. By immunohistochemistry, we found nuclear, perinuclear, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi vesicle, secretion and apical cytoplasmic stainings in gynecomastias and sporadic and hereditary male breast cancers, for BRCA1 and BRCA2 protein expressions. We report an extensive expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in different compartments of the mammary gland cells in male breast carcinomas and gynecomastias. This is consistent with the estrogen-dependent expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in human breast cells.},

	abstract = {Carcinoma of the male breast (MBC) is an uncommon phenomenon, accounting for <1% of all malignancies in man. It represents a biologically heterogeneous disorder, and its clinical course may vary from indolent and slowly progressive to rapidly metastatic disease. Most of our current knowledge regarding its biology, natural history, and treatment strategies has been extrapolated from its female counterpart. Information regarding prognostic relevance of new molecular markers is limited. At the European Institute of Oncology we performed a study showing data in which p21Waf1 and p27Kip1 proteins were evaluated in a series of male breast cancer patients. Our data suggest that the immunohistochemical evaluation of p21Waf1 and p27Kip1 expression in male breast carcinomas may be a further useful marker for selecting patients who express functional proteins that can be predictive for the most efficient endocrine response. Moreover, searching for more conservative treatment, we introduced in our clinical practice sentinel node biopsy, and if present, sentinel node biopsy of the internal mammary chain. The potential clinical implications of complete nodal staging are far-reaching, and give us a major new opportunity to stratify male patients with breast cancer for appropriate surgery as well as giving valuable prognostic information. Male breast cancer has biological differences compared with female breast cancer. It responds to hormonal manipulation and chemotherapy, but optimal treatment regimens in males are unknown. By analogy to the female breast cancer, post-mastectomy radiotherapy should be proposed in case of advanced T stage and/or lymph node positivity (considering the small volume of the male mammary gland, we suggest post-mastectomy irradiation in case of T >1 cm and/or presence of >1 metastatic axillary lymph node). Breast conserving surgery, performed in selected cases of male breast cancer, should be always followed by radiotherapy. Despite a wealth of small retrospective studies on MBC, its rarity means there is a lack of prospective randomized controlled treatment trials, which needs to be addressed if significant advances are to be made in the treatment of this unusual challenging disease.},

Data from six in-depth interviews with men who had breast cancer identified seven major issues. These were associated with delay in diagnosis, shock, stigma, body image, causal factors, the provision of information and emotional support. The findings from this small study suggest that there are psychological and social factors for men diagnosed with breast cancer which have implications for their care and management. The recommendations arising from this study are the development of a structured education programme aimed at all primary health-care professionals; with availability of pre and postoperative gender-specific information to alleviate the potential psychological problems associated with the diagnosis; and provision of appropriate support/counselling services for partners of patients.

Although the metastatic tumor was estrogen receptor-positive, hormone therapy combined with chemotherapy had no significant effect on tumor growth, and the patient died from disseminated tumors 2 years 6 months after completion of the adjuvant therapy. It is noteworthy that the circulating estradiol level increased from 18.0 to 892.3 pg/ml during the period of tumor progression and dissemination. We interpret these findings as an indication of high aromatase activity in the metastatic tumors. We suggest that extending tamoxifen treatment to 5 years or longer be recommended for the standard adjuvant hormone therapy of male breast cancer to prevent the early recurrence of hormone-responsive disease.},

	abstract = {Treatments for men with breast cancer are based largely on accepted regimens for women with the disease. Surgical treatment of the primary tumor should be a mastectomy. Lymph node assessment can be done by conventional axillary node dissection or, similar to selected women with small primary tumors, by sentinel node dissection. Decisions regarding adjuvant systemic treatment should be made on the same basis as for women. Axillary node status, tumor size, hormone receptor status, and the health of the patient are important considerations in determining what adjuvant treatment is offered. The role of radiation after mastectomy in men is not well defined, but radiation should be used in patients at high risk for local recurrence. For patients with metastatic disease, treatment is based on the hormone receptor status of the tumor and is similar to the treatment for women. Because most men with breast cancer have hormone receptor-positive disease, hormonal therapy is a mainstay of treatment and tamoxifen remains the front-line drug of choice, although the latest generation of aromatase inhibitors have supplanted tamoxifen as a first-line therapy for women. As a second-line hormonal therapy for men, orchiectomy or a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist with or without an antiandrogen are reasonable alternatives. There are no reports regarding the use of the antiestrogen fulvestrant in men, but its mechanism of action and efficacy in women suggest that it will be a useful agent in hormone receptor-positive male breast cancer. For men with hormoneresistant disease, palliative chemotherapy with the same agents used for treatment of women with breast cancer is appropriate. © 2003, Current Science Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease. This study reports the results of a treatment including radiotherapy of a single institution. Material and Methods: The hospital charts of 23 patients with nonmetastatic MBC treated from 1971 to 1991 were reviewed. The tumor was located centrally or medially in 10 patients. Tumor classification: Tis C3 n = 1, pT1 n = 2, pT2 n = 8, T2 C3 n = 1, pT3 n = 4, pT4 n = 6, unknown n = 1, cN0 n = 8, cN+ n = 1, pN0 n = 5, pN+ n = 9. Biopsy only was performed in 2 patients, tumorectomy in 2 patients and radical or modified radical mastectomy in 19 patients. Radiotherapy was given to the chest wall (median total dose 46 Gy) in all patients but two (who had only irradiation of the nodes) and to the axillary/supraclavicular nodes (median total dose 48 Gy) in all patients but two (who had only chest wall irradiation). In 5 patients radiation of the mammaria interna nodes was added to the supraclavicular field (median total dose 48 Gy). 5 patients with known receptor status were treated with adjuvant hormone therapy. Median follow-up was 62 (6-182) months. Results: 19 patients died, 15 with tumor. The median overall survival time was 63 months, the disease-specific 5-year and 10-year survival rate was 69% and 35%, respectively. There were 3 chest wall relapses in one of two nonirradiated patients and in one of two only irradiated patients, respectively. Distant metastases occurred in 12 patients. Conclusion: This study supports adjuvant radiotherapy for treatment of advanced male breast cancer.},

	abstract = {We report a population-based case-control study on risk factors for male breast cancer. Data on a broad range of previously suggested risk factors were collected in a set of Scandinavian breast cancer cases and matched controls. Incident cases (n = 282) with histologically verified carcinomas of the breast were identified from notification to the cancer registries of Denmark, Norway and Sweden over a 4-year period 1987-1991 and of these cases, 156 men could be approached and responded. Controls were identified through national central population registers and were matched individually for country, sex and year of birth. Controls with a diagnosis of breast cancer were excluded; 468 of 780 controls responded. Data on risk factors were collected by self-administered questionnaires mailed to the cases between land 2 years after diagnosis and to controls during the same period. The findings were compatible with an increased risk associated with family history of breast cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-5.6), obesity 10 years before diagnosis (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.0-4.5) for BMI > 30, diabetes (OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.3) and the use of digoxin and methyldopa (OR = 2.0 and 2.1, respectively). The association with family history of breast cancer has been repeated in several studies, while the relation to anthropometric measures has been equivocal. We could not substantiate some associations seen in other studies; namely those with high education, fertility, marital status, testicular injury, liver disease and religion. The detailed questions about gynaecomastia indicated that many cases reported signs of breast cancer as a gynaecomastia. This type of misunderstanding may explain the strong association with gynaecomastia seen in other studies. Several patients died before contact. Thus, risk factors related to a more aggressive male breast cancer or related to high risk of dying (e.g. liver cirrhosis, heavy smoking) may have been missed.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Germline mutations of the BRCA2 gene are involved in the development of a considerable number of male breast cancer cases. Although phenotypic differences have been observed between sporadic and BRCA-related breast carcinomas, conflicting data exist on the differences in prognosis of women with hereditary and sporadic breast cancer. The purpose of the study was to investigate the prognostic value of BRCA2 status in male breast carcinoma (MBC). Experimental Design: We studied 43 male breast cancer patients, including 12 with BRCA2 mutations. Tumor samples were characterized immunohistochemically using antibodies to estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and androgen receptor (AR). Results: BRCA2-related tumors presented at the earlier age compared with sporadic tumors (P = 0.005). Patients positive and negative for BRCA2 mutations did not differ with respect to tumor size, lymph node involvement, histological grade, and sex hormone receptor status. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly decreased in BRCA2-positive patients (67% versus 28% for BRCA2-negative versus positive patients, respectively, P = 0.017 for DFS; 86% versus 25%, P = 0.006 for OS). Shorter survival was also correlated with expression of AR in tumor tissue (74% versus 33% for patients with tumors staining negatively and positively for AR, P = 0.029 for DFS; 71% versus 57%, P = 0.05 for OS). Conclusions: The BRCA2 mutations and AR expression in tumor tissue are independent adverse factors for MBC prognosis. BRCA2-related MBC presents at the earlier age compared with non-BRCA2-related cancer, but do not differ with respect to other clinicopathological features.},

	abstract = {Relatively little attention has been paid to the aetiology of male breast cancer and the current understanding of female breast cancer, primarily related to reproductive events, cannot be readily transferred to understanding the cancer in males. However, since male breast cancer occurs in the absence of factors related to childbearing and menstruation, its aetiology may provide special insights into the causes of breast cancer in women. We examined lifestyle risk factors for male breast cancer as part of a Canadian, multi-site, population-based, case-control study. Eighty-one newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed cases and 1905 male controls aged 42-74 were analysed using unconditional logistic regression. Increased risks were found for men with a mother or sister with breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.62-8.19). Higher physical activity levels (moderate, and strenuous recreational plus occupational) were associated with a decreased risk of male breast cancer (highest quartile, adjusted OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26-0.91). Similarly, higher risks were associated with higher weight 2 years before interview (2.19, 95% CI 1.08-4.43), maximum weight (OR 2.66) and higher body mass index (OR 1.60). Higher vegetable consumption and coffee consumption were associated with decreased risk, whereas higher beta-carotene, vitamin E and calcium supplementation were associated with statistically significant increased risk. The small number of cases and multiple comparisons preclude strong conclusions, but our study is consistent with studies suggesting obesity and family history increase risk, and physical activity decreases risk of breast cancer. © 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Molecular genetic analysis indicates that the BRCA2 gene plays an important role in familial male breast cancer. To determine a possible involvement of this tumor suppressor gene in sporadic male breast cancer, we examined 30 sporadic male breast carcinomas for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at two loci on chromosome 13q12-13, a region that spans the BRCA2 locus. Sixteen of 24 (67%) informative cases showed LOH in at least one marker on chromosome 13q12-13. The affected cases included both invasive ductal carcinomas and other types of invasive breast carcinoma and were detected preferentially in patients who were 50 years or older, in patients with lymph node metastasis, and in progesterone receptor-negative cases. We report, for the first time, a high frequency of LOH at chromosome 13q12-13 in sporadic male breast cancer and its association with factors indicating a poor prognosis for this tumor (e.g., lymph node metastasis and negative progesterone receptor status). These findings suggest an important role for BRCA2 in the development and progression of sporadic male breast cancer.},

Family histories were obtained, and the men were tested for germ-line mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Seven of these patients had a significant family history of breast cancer (i.e., at least one first- or second-degree relative with breast cancer diagnosed before age 70). Two of the men carried BRCA2 mutations, but no BRCA1 mutations were found. Both mutation carriers reported a positive family history and a personal history of cancer that preceded their diagnosis of breast cancer. Our results support the recommendation that male breast cancer patients who have a significant family history of breast or ovarian cancer should be offered genetic counseling and testing.},

	abstract = {Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is rapidly becoming the standard of care in the treatment of women with early stage breast cancer. Male breast cancer although relatively rare, has typically been treated with mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Men who develop breast carcinoma have the same risk as their female counterparts of developing the morbidities associated with axillary dissection. SLNB has been championed as a procedure aimed at preventing those morbidities. We recently have evaluated the role of SLNB in the treatment of men with early stage breast cancer. Methods: Among the 18 men treated at the University of Michigan Medical Center for breast cancer from May 1998 to November 2002, 6 were treated with SLNB. Results: The mean tumor size was 1.6 cm. The mean patient age was 59.8 years. All of the patients had one or more sentinel lymph nodes identified. Two of the six did not have confirmatory axillary dissection. Three of the six had positive sentinel lymph nodes (50%). Only one of the three patients with a positive sentinel node had more nodes positive. One of the six patients had a positive node on frozen section and underwent immediate complete axillary dissection. This patient had no additional positive nodes. No patients in our series had immunohistochemical studies of the lymph nodes. Conclusions: Men with early stage breast carcinoma may be offered the management option of SLNB since in the hands of experienced surgeons it has a success rate apparently equal to that in their female counterparts. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer represents with 1.5% of male malignancies a rare disease. Compared to the vast amount of data and knowledge in female breast cancer, male breast cancer is less well-researched and explored. Potential risk factors are oestrogen (exogenous or endogenous), gynaecomastia, radiation, exposure to heat and the Klinefelter's syndrome. Whereas female breast cancer shows a double-peak risk distribution, the risk for males to develop breast cancer increases linearly with age. Bilateral male breast cancer is extremely rare. All kinds of histological tumour types described in female patients were observed in male breast cancer too. The prognosis for male breast cancer is, if at equal stage, comparable to that of female breast cancer. Similar as in their female counterparts, survival of the male patients depends on tumour size and axillary lymph node status, and because of this it depends on an early diagnosis. Oestrogen and progesterone receptor status, however, are of lesser prognostic significance in male breast cancer. Therapeutic advances were analogous to the treatment of female breast cancer. Besides the introduction of less radical surgical procedures, hormonal ablative surgical procedures were replaced by medical therapy. Tamoxifen therapy in nodal-positive patients of tumour stages II and III resulted in 5-year survival rates of 60 to 85%. Even in patients showing distant metastases, response rates of 40 to 60% can be obtained by applying the different chemotherapeutic strategies for female breast cancer patients.},

The duration of symptoms before treatment ranged from a few days to 6 years, averaging 31.33 months. Differentiation of male breast cancer from gynecomastia is important, especially in males beyond middle age. Male breast cancer is of the same pathological types as seen in females. As with female breast cancer, surgical excision, especially radical mastectomy seems to be the treatment of choice. Supplementary therapeutics including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy and traditional Chinese medicine are beneficial in appropriately selected patients. Factors influencing patient prognosis include type of treatment, clinical stage of the disease, histological type of tumor, grade of malignancy, presence or absence of axillary lymph node metastasis, degree of pericancerous lymphoid reaction and elastic fiber reaction. In other words, the prognosis is determined by many factors, all of which should be considered when evaluating patient's outcome. How these factors influence the prognosis is not entirely clear and requires further elucidation.},

	abstract = {All malignant tumours of the male breast diagnosed in Iceland during the 40-year period 1955-1994 were studied with regard to histological classification, tumour grading and flow cytometric analysis. Of 31 malignant tumours diagnosed, 29 were primary breast carcinomas. Male breast carcinoma constitutes 1% of all breast malignancies in Iceland and 0.25% of all malignant tumours in males. About 80% of the male breast carcinomas were diagnosed during the latter half of the study period. The mean age of the patients was 66.3 years and the left-to-right ratio was 1.9:1.0. Right-sided tumours appeared to be more aggressive. The mean tumour size was 2.6 cm. The vast majority of the carcinomas (79%) were of the infiltrating ductal type. Of these 21.7% were grade 1, 43.5% were grade II and 34.8% grade III. Papillary carcinomas made up 17% of the total. These occurred in slightly older patients than the infiltrating ductal carcinomas and were diploid tumours. In this study 57% of the tumours were found to be aneuploid, but nearly 70% of the invasive ductal carcinomas NOS were aneuploid. In general, the aneuploid tumours were larger, of higher average histological grade and had a higher mean S-phase value. The overall mean S-phase fraction was 7.2% which is similar to that found in female breast tumours in Iceland. It is concluded that the male-to-female ratio of breast carcinoma in Iceland is similar to that found in other Western countries. The age-standardised incidence has increased considerably in the last 20 years, in contrast to the rates reported from most other countries. Papillary tumours are unusually common in Icelandic males.},

Diagnosis can be confirmed by fine-needle aspiration or surgical biopsy. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma is the predominant histologic type. After primary surgical treatment, men with axillary lymph node metastasis should receive adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. The use of radiation therapy for local control of the disease is recommended if there is invasion of the chest wall.

	abstract = {Trends in death certification rates from male breast cancer over the period 1955–89 were analysed for 25 European countries (excluding the Soviet Union and a few small countries) on the basis of official data from the World Health Organization database. In the late 1980's, about 550–600 deaths per year from male breast cancer were certified in these countries. The variation was relatively limited, most age‐standardized (world standard) rates being within the range of 1.5 to 3.0 per million. The highest rates were in France, Hungary, Austria and Scotland. No clear pattern of trend was observed over the last few decades, but mortality rates in the late 1980's tended to be, for most countries, lower than those registered 3 decades earlier. Comparison was possible for 18 countries, and for 11 (including the largest ones, i.e. France, Germany, Italy and England and Wales), male breast cancer rates in 1985–89 were lower than in 1955–59. The pattern was similar when only truncated (from 35 to 64 years) mortality rates were considered and, for the largest countries, upon accurate inspection of age‐specific rates. In conclusion, therefore, this overview of male breast cancer trends in Europe precludes any generalized increase in mortality from the disease over recent decades and, hence, weighs against the introduction and presence of any important new cause of this rare disease.

	abstract = {Background. Although an uncommon disease, male breast cancer (MBC) will be responsible for 300 deaths in 1993 in the United States. Because of the high rate of estrogen receptor positivity in males, adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting has been used widely. Little is known about the side effects of this estrogen receptor blocker in males. Methods. The authors evaluated the side effects of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment in 24 patients (19 of whom were estrogen receptor positive) treated at the authors' institution between 1990 and 1993. Results. Fifteen (62.5%) patients reported at least one side effect. The most common side effect was a decrease in libido, which occurred in 7 (29.2%) patients; followed by weight gain, which occurred in 6 (25%) patients; hot flashes, which occurred in (5 20.8%); mood alterations, which occurred in 5 (20.8%); depression, which occurred in 4 (16.6%); insomnia, which occurred in 3 (12.5%); and deep venous thrombosis, which occurred in 1 (4.2%). Five (20.8%) patients terminated treatment with tamoxifen in less than 1 year because of these side effects. Two of these patients had decreased libido, two had hot flashes, and one suffered deep venous thrombosis. Conclusions. In contrast to female breast cancer patients, who have a 4% attrition rate to adjuvant tamoxifen treatment, MBC patients have a 20.8% attrition rate related to side effects of tamoxifen treatment.

	abstract = {We screened thirteen male breast cancers for the presence of germline mutations in exons 2 and 3 encoding the DNA-binding domain of the androgen receptor. These two exons were amplified from genomic DNA extracted from patients' white blood cells. In one of these thirteen patients, single strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing detected a guanine-adenine point mutation at nucleotide 2185 that changes Arg608 into Lys in a highly conserved region of the second zinc finger of the androgen receptor. This mutation occurred in a 38 year old man with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome and normal androgen-binding capacity in cultured genital skin fibroblasts. To our knowledge, only one germline Arg to Gin androgen receptor gene mutation has been previously reported at position 607 in male breast cancer. This androgen receptor mutation along with the Arg608 into Lys mutation we describe, suggests that this genetic abnormality is not fortuitous: a decrease in androgen action within the breast cells could account for the development of male breast cancer by the loss of a protective effect of androgens on these cells. Activation of estrogen regulated genes by the change of DNA-binding characteristics of the mutant androgen receptor cannot, however, be ruled out. © 1993 Oxford University Press.},

The male to female sex ratio of the number of deaths from breast cancer over the period between 1950-1994 was 1:103.6. The age-specific death rates of breast cancer in males rose steadily with age while the rates in females having the peak in the latter half of the sixth decade, then decreasing, rising again in the ninth decade for the years 1973-1993. The number of deaths from breast cancer has increased, and while the crude death rate has risen from 1948-1952 to 1988-1992 in both sexes, and the increasing trend in females was larger than that in males in recent years. On the other hand, the age-adjusted death rate from breast cancer has leveled off or decreased in males while the rate in females has increased over the last few decades. Thus, the female to male sex ratios of both the number of deaths and the death rates from breast cancer increased continuously in recent years. The average age at death from breast cancer in males gained 11.7 years during the last 40 years (71.2 years old in 1988-1992 vs 59.5 years in 1948-1952), but only 3.1 years in females (58.6 vs 55.5).},

	abstract = {Male breast cancer is a rare tumour in all parts of the world. About 1% of all breast cancers occur in men, but the male/female ratio is higher among black than among white populations. This effect can be seen in US cancer registries and even more markedly in African data. A positive correlation exists on a population scale between male breast cancer and prostate cancer. Seven case‐control studies of male breast cancer are available, and a pooled analysis was conducted of the most commonly suspected risk factors. Male breast cancer appears to be associated with marital status: Mantel‐Haenszel exposure odds ratio (EOR) for never married = 1.6; 95% confidence limits (CL) = 1.1, 2.3, religion (EOR for being Jewish = 2.1; 95% CL = 1.4, 3.2), previous breast pathology (EOR for positive history of benign breast disease = 2.7; 95% CL = 1.7, 4.2), gynaecomastia (EOR for positive history = 6.2, 95% CL = 3.4, 11.4), previous testicular pathology (EOR for positive history = 2.2; 95% CL = 1.5, 3.3), previous liver diseases (EOR for positive history = 1.6; 95% CL = 1.0, 2.4) and family history of breast cancer (EOR for first‐degree relative with breast cancer = 2.5; 95% CL = 1.7, 3.7). No association is found with smoking history. Other potential risk factors such as reproductive history, education, occupation, anthropometric variables, association with various diseases, and specific exposures such as drug use, were not systematically evaluated in all studies and provide sometimes contradictory results, possibly due to small numbers of exposed subjects. Overall, the analytical epidemiology of male breast cancer presents similarities with the epidemiology of female breast cancer, with a potential role of factors related to hormonal status, relative hyperoestrogeny in men being potentially linked to increased risk of disease. Genetics may also play a role, with high risk linked to a familial history of breast cancer, and with a major risk in patients with Klinefelter's syndrome.

The logarithm of incidence increased linearly with the logarithm of age and had a slope of about 5. In Denmark, male breast cancer incidence increased significantly with time, about 1% per year. No significant time effects were observed in the other countries. A significant effect of birth cohort appeared in Sweden only, but there was no particular trend in incidence by year of birth. In relation to Denmark, the risk of male breast cancer was lower in Sweden, Norway and Finland, the relative risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals being 0.82(0.72–0.94), 0.72(0.61–0.84) and 0.53(0.43–0.64) respectively.

More educated men tended to be at higher risk of breast cancer, with a multivariate odds ratio (OR) of 2.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-9.4]. The OR was 3.2 (95% CI 1.1-9.6) for those in the higher social class. Men with no offspring were at higher risk than fathers, with an OR of 5.5 (95% CI 1.8-16.7). A history of breast cancer in female relatives was reported by two cases and one control, giving an OR of 8.5 (95% CI 1.1-69.0). Cases were somewhat heavier than controls, and significantly taller, with an OR of 5.7 (95% CI 1.6-19.9) for subjects taller than 170 cm vs shorter ones. The association with weight, however, decreased after allowance for height, and no difference was observed for body mass index. Socioeconomic correlates and family history are similar to well-assessed risk factors for female breast cancer. The associations with anthropometric measures and childlessness may find an explanation in chromosomal abnormalities, such as Klinefelter’s syndrome, or other hormone-related disorders. © 1995 Stockton Press.

We studied 22 tumors from males, 18 invasive carcinomas, three of which were papillary, and three in situ tumors of which one was papillary, and one papilloma. Our data support the previously reported high incidence of papillary carcinoma in men. Estrogen receptor status and the expression of cancer-associated antigens recognized by antibodies DF3, B73.2, SP-1, and c-erbB-2 were compared to matched tumors from females. Immunocytochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections using standard avidin-biotin techniques; anti-PSA was used to exclude the possibility of metatastic prostate cancer, and 12 cases of gynecomastia were included as nonmalignant controls. The incidence of estrogen receptor positivity was higher in tumors from males (73%) than from females (54%), as has been reported previously. The range of expression of all breast cancer antigens tested in male tumors was similar to that observed in females, but some interesting differences were noted. With the exception of the anti-mucin DF3, all the antibodies reacted only with neoplastic tissues. Expression of the oncoprotein c-erbB-2 was lower (17%) in males than in females (33%), despite the preponderance in men of the large-cell type carcinomas that have been associated with c-erbB-2 expression. Unexpectedly, the pregnancy-associated hormone detected by SP-1 was expressed in 33% of tumors from males and, in contrast to females, was found in less differentiated tumors.},

Mutant ARs revealed normal androgen-binding affinities and weaker DNA binding to an isolated androgen-responsive element. In cotransfection assays the mutant ARs displayed a reduced transactivation efficiency at 0.3.10-10 M. Neither binding to an estrogen-responsive element nor transactivation efficiency of an ERE reporter gene was observed. Molecular modeling revealed that Arg607 and Arg608 were partially surface-exposed and located in adjacent areas in the AR-DBD complex with DNA. This is in favor of a protein-protein interaction. It is conceivable that such an interaction could be affected by mutation of one of these two arginines.},

	abstract = {A retrospective study has been undertaken of 104 men with breast cancer, all of them having a follow‐up period of at least 5 years. In 78 cases a histological diagnosis was obtained. The preferred treatment for operable cases was radical mastectomy, in which 60 per cent positive axillary nodes were found. Five‐year survival is 54 per cent and the disease‐free interval is 42 per cent. Local recurrence occurred in 26 per cent and 16 per cent had developed distant metastases. The overall results are similar to those in the literature with the exception of those for stage III who did better in this series. The generally held beliefs that Klinefelter's syndrome is the strongest predisposing factor to developing male breast cancer and that gynaecomastia is not a premalignant condition are supported by this study. Comparison of results from this series, with those of women of the same age having breast cancer leads to the conclusion that the prognosis in male breast cancer is no worse than for women with comparable disease.

	abstract = {From 1960 to 1986, 397 cases of non-metastatic male breast cancer (MBC) treated in 14 French regional cancer centres were reviewed. The median age was 64 years (range 25-93). TNM classification (UICC, 1978) showed seven TO, 79 T1, 162 T2, 31 T3, 74 T4 and 44 unclassified tumours (Tx). Clinical positive lymph nodes were found in 31% of the patients. 24 patients received radiotherapy only, and 373 underwent surgery, 247 of these with postoperative irradiation. Adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy were used in 71 and 68 patients, respectively. There were 382 infiltrating carcinomas and 15 pure ductal carcinoma in situ. Lymph node involvement was found in 56% of infiltrating carcinoma. The oestregen (ER) and progesterone (PgR) receptors were positive in 79% and 77%, respectively, of examined cases. Isolated local and regional recurrence were observed in 8.8% and 4.5% of cases, respectively and 40% of patients developed metastases. The crude survival rates by Kaplan-Meier method were 65% and 38% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and the disease-specific survival rates (without death due to intercurrent disease or second cancer) was 74% at 5 years and 51% at 10 years. The disease-specific survival rate for pN- and pN+ groups were 77% and 39% at 10 years. The prognostic factors were clinical size (T) and histological axillary status (pN-/pN+). The relative risk of death for pN- was 1.0, 2.0 and 3.2 in the T0-T1, T2 and T3-T4 groups, respectively. For pN+, these relative risks increased 1.9, 3.9 and 6.0 in the same groups. The optimal treatment include modified radical mastectomy and irradiation for cases with risk factors of local relapse (nodal invasion, large tumour with cutaneous or muscular involvement). Locoregional failure had unfavourable prognosis. First-line adjuvant treatment seems to be tamoxifen, due to the very high rate of positive hormonal receptors and the old age of the patients, which contraindicate chemotherapy in many cases. The prognosis of patients with breast cancer is the same in male and female patients when disease-specific survival rate, tumour size and axillary involvement are compared. © 1995.},

Although 90% of breast masses in men are malignant, delay in diagnosis often occurs with resultant advanced local or systemic disease common. The few clinical studies on male breast cancer suggest that the disease behaves similarly to female breast cancer. Management, therefore, should be similar to the management of female breast cancer. Stage I, II, and III disease require a multimodal approach with regional therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Most male breast cancers are estrogen or progesterone receptor positive and responses to hormonal therapy are high. A trial of hormonal therapy is warranted in most patients with stage IV disease.},

The majority of tumors were T1 or T2, and infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the predominant histological type. Axillary nodal status and histological grade were predictive of survival. The pattern of recurrence and survival rates were similar to those seen in women. Some differences, however, were evident. Tumors were centrally located in the majority of patients and there was a high frequency of nipple involvement. The hormone receptor positivity rate was high and the median age at presentation was older. In comparison to a previous report of the same disease from this institution 10 years ago, fewer patients underwent radical surgical procedures and more patients received adjuvant systemic therapy. These approaches are justified since there are many biological similarities between breast cancer in men and women.},

Two gene loci linked to the inherited predisposition to breast cancer have been identified on chromosomes 17q and 13q, BRCA1 and BRCA2 respectively. BRCA2 is implicated in the pathogenesis of male breast cancer whereas BRCA1 has not been associated with this tumour. Linkage studies were performed using polymorphic markers and preliminary results suggest that BRCA1 may be implicated in one of these families.},

	abstract = {Data were collected on 169 men treated for breast cancer at 36 surgical departments in Austria between 1970 and 1991. We report here several of their clinical features and assess the importance of established prognostic factors. After a median observation period of 51 months 60 patients (35%) suffered a recurrence. The estimated 5-year recurrence-free survival for the entire group was 55%, and the estimated 5-year overall survival was 62%. Although stage-adjusted data are comparable to those for female breast cancer, the outcome in this series may be attributed to a relatively high frequency of advanced tumor stages. Tumor size (recurrence-free survival p=0.00001; overall survival p=0.03) and axillary lymph node status (recurrence-free survival p=0.0001; overall survival p=0.0001) proved to have a prognostic impact. Using a multivariate analysis, axillary lymph node status (recurrence-free survival p=0.001; overall survival p=0.01) still had prognostic influence. The various procedures used had no effect on local recurrence. © 1995 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

In particular, remissions occurred in 7 of 11 instances with cyproterone acetate, in 3 of 7 with tamoxifen, in 2 of 5 with estrogens, in 2 of 5 with aminoglutethimide, in none of 3 with high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate, in none of 1 with androgens, and in 1 of 3 with castration. The response to additive hormonal therapy was 44%. Median overall response duration was 10 months, 11 months following additive hormonal therapy. Median survival from start of therapy was longer in responding than in nonresponding patients (23.5 vs. 11 months). A disease-free interval did not appear to influence hormonal response. Patients responding to one form of hormonal treatment had a greater likelihood of responding to subsequent hormonal manipulations. Additive hormonal therapy may provide effective palliation in males with advanced breast cancer, and should be considered as a valid alternative to orchiectomy. © 1985 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

As a result of larger studies based upon female patients, treatment algorithms have evolved to include multimodality therapy and less radical surgery. Continued research of this disease will continue to define improved methods of detection, prevention, and treatment, and, without the confounding variables of the menstrual cycle, menopause, and childbirth, may also provide a clearer understanding of breast cancer in women.},

Cases were significantly more likely to be Jewish than were the controls, supporting earlier suggestions of an increased risk in Jewish males. A significant association of male breast cancer with mumps infections at age 20 years or older, along with the possible association with antecedent testicular injury and the excess frequency of mumps orchitis among cases, suggests that testicular factors may be important in the development of breast cancer among males. An increased frequency of breast cancer among persons who have worked in blast furnaces, steel works, and rolling mills is of interest because of the possible testicular effect of high environmental temperatures. The observed association between breast cancer and a prior history of swollen breast is difficult to interpret because of potential recall bias, and a possible relationship with military service needs further confirmation.},

During the last five years, we treated 242 cases of breast cancer, including 2 cases of male breast cancer. In this paper, we describe the two cases of male breast cancer. Both of the two patients, 60 and 56 year old men, complained of tumor formation in the nipple region. In both cases tumors were suspected to be malignat by mammography or ultrasonography and excisional biopsy disclosed breast cancer. Standard radical mastectomy was proceeded for the first patient and modified radical mastectomy for the second patient. Postoperative findings were t1 n1a M0, stage 1 and t2 n0 M0, stage 1, respectively and Estrogen receptors were positive in both patients. There are no signs of recurrence at 45 months and 15 months respectively after surgery. Generally, prognosis of male breast cancer has been thought to be poor. Recent improvement in diagnostic methods and treatments, however, could offer better treatment outcomes. A review of our cases and relevant references has indicated a relatively good prognosis for male breast cancer, especially in early stages and modified radical mastectomy appears to be applicable to the Stage 1 and N0 cancers. © 1995, Japanese Society of National Medical Services.

The recent cloning of BRCA1 allows for the direct detection of mutations, but the feasibility of presymptomatic screening for cancer susceptibility is unknown. We analyzed genomic DNA from one affected individual from each of 24 families with at least three cases of ovarian or breast cancer, using SSCP assays. Variant SSCP hands were subcloned and sequenced. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify sequence changes and to screen DNA from control individuals. Six frameshift and two missense mutations were detected in 10 different families. A frameshift mutation was detected in a male proband affected with both breast and prostate cancer. A 40-bp deletion was detected in a patient who developed intra-abdominal carcinomatosis 1 year after prophylactic oophorectomy. Mutations were detected throughout the gene, and only one was detected in more than a single family. These results provide further evidence that inherited breast and ovarian cancer can occur as a consequence of a wide array of BRCA1 mutations. These results suggests that development of a screening test for BRCA1 mutations will be technically challenging. The finding of a mutation in a family with male breast cancer, not previously thought to be related to BRCA1, also illustrates the potential difficulties of genetic counseling for individuals known to carry mutations.},

Clinico-pathological features documented were in agreement with those reported by other authors. The overall 5-year survival was 53%. Tumour grade and lymph-node status influenced prognosis. In this series, 64% of the tumours expressed ERs, 50% pS2, 46% cathepsin D, 42% the c-erb-B2 transmembrane oncoprotein and 54% p53. In contrast to female breast cancer, the presence of either substantial amounts of ERs or the oestrogen-dependent protein pS2 correlated with poorer prognosis in males. This correlation has not previously been documented.},

Other statistically significant risk factors identified were family history of breast cancer and therapeutic use of digitalis. Elevated risks, although not significant, were observed for individuals with a past history of tuberculosis, hyperthyroidism, liver cirrhosis or gallstone, who had been treated with isoniazid, or who had worked in high environmental temperatures.

A total of 1429 (98.4%) of all patients diagnosed during a 25‐year to 30‐year period and reported to the Nordic cancer registries were available for follow‐up through 1982. The relative survival rate was lower in older patients; the relative excess risk of dying (from breast cancer) during the first 5 years of observation, calculated by multiple regression modelling, increased in a regular fashion more than three‐fold from patients younger than 40 years at diagnosis to those aged 80 years or older. Significantly lower rates were found among males in Denmark and Finland, the relative excess risks of dying (compared with Sweden) being 1.39 (1.06‐‐1.80) and 1.73 (1.22‐‐2.45), respectively, during the first 5 years. The authors concluded first that important differences exist between male and female patients with breast cancer in the relation between survival and age at diagnosis, and secondly that a later stage at presentation or national differences in the natural history are the most likely explanations for the worse prognosis in Denmark and Finland.

The proportion of cancers positive for c-erbB-2 (45%), EGFR (20%), p53 (58%), MiB1 (40%), NCRC11 (78%), were similar to reports for female breast cancer. Nonsignficant associations between poor survival outcome and grade 3 tumours, and positive tissue staining for MiB1 and p53 were seen. Conclusions. While there are similarities in the biological features of breast cancer in males and females, some differences were identified Male breast cancer is more likely to be grade 3 tumours and hormone receptor positive.},

Median length of follow-up was 6.7 years and was complete for 93% of patients. Presenting complaints were most frequently a mass (95%) or pain (31%) while physical examination revealed the tumour to be central in 95% of patients with nipple or skin retraction in 36% and associated gynaecomastia in 12%. Twenty-seven per cent of the patients had a positive family history of breast cancer, 6% noted previous breast trauma and 7% had prior chest wall irradiation. Mean tumour size was 2.5 cm, and the pathological stage was 0 in 3%, I in 17%, II in 22%, III in 35%, IV in 11%, and unknown in 12%. Ninety-four per cent were ductal carcinoma. Histological grading of tumours was 2% grade 1, 10% grade 2, 33% grade 3 and 48% grade 4. Ninety-two per cent of patients underwent mastectomy (41% radical, 39% modified radical and 12% simple), while adjuvant irradiation was used in 44% and chemotherapy in 9%. Median disease-free patient survival was 5 years (36% of patients developed tumour recurrence). Median overall patient survival was 6.3 years (57% at 5 years and 31% at 10 years). Tumour size (P < 0.05), pathological stage (P < 0.04), and tumour grade (P = 0.007) were adverse factors for recurrence, while pathological stage (P < 0.02), tumour size (P < 0.03), pain (P < 0.05) and age (P < 0.02) were associated with a decreased survival. Duration of symptoms or type of mastectomy had no effect on recurrence or survival. When data for the first 25 years were compared to those of the second 25 years, no differences were observed in patient survival, tumour recurrence, duration of symptoms, stage of disease or size of tumour, though the use of adjuvant radiation and the performance of radical mastectomy decreased from 78 and 82 to 15 and 12, respectively. Breast carcinoma in males affects an older population, is often advanced at diagnosis, and is frequently fatal.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether breast cancer has a similar prognosis in males and females. METHODS: A 20-year retrospective study of all male breast cancer patients in our region was undertaken. We compared this series with a group of females matched for the major prognostic factors and an unmatched series of female patients treated over the same period. RESULTS: Forty-one patients with invasive cancer and 2 with ductal carcinoma in situ were identified. One invasive cancer was treated with radiotherapy, 40 had surgery. Local recurrence occurred in 23% and axillary recurrence in 40% of cases. Male and female patients (n = 123) matched for the major prognostic factors showed a similar outcome for disease-free interval (P = 0.90) and survival (P = 0.27). However, both the above groups had a significantly worse outcome than the unmatched series of female patients with breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: When prognostic factors are allowed for, male and female breast cancer patients have a similar outcome. This suggests that such features should be taken into account when determining management for males with breast cancer just as they are in females.},

	abstract = {A retrospective chart review was conducted of men with the diagnosis of carcinoma of the breast seen at this institution between January 1967 and March 1981. Eighty-nine patients were available for analysis. These cases were evaluated to determine whether the natural history of this disease was similar to that of women with carcinoma of the breast and to identify prognostic variables in carcinoma of the male breast. The results of this review would suggest that many similarities exist between breast cancer in women and in men. The most common presenting symptom is a lump, the patterns of recurrence are similar for both men and women, and survival is determined by initial T stage and the presence or absence of nodes. Local postoperative radiotherapy does not influence overall survival in male breast cancer but does decrease the incidence of chest wall recurrence. Survival after recurrence is short and is similar to that observed for women with recurrent carcinoma of the breast. The differences observed in the present series were that the median age at presentation of 63.6 years is somewhat greater than that usually observed in women; no cases of lobular carcinoma were observed; and in the 44 patients who developed recurrences to date, none had evidence of liver metastases as the initial site of recurrence. In most respects the natural history of male breast cancer is similar to that of carcinoma of the breast in women. Since carcinoma of the male breast is a relatively rare malignancy, it is reasonable to recommend management of this disease be based on the greater base of knowledge available for carcinoma of the female breast.},

We have examined 22 families with at least one case of male breast cancer for linkage to the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer locus, BRCA1, on chromosome 17q. We found strong evidence against linkage to BRCA1 (lod score – 16.63) and the best estimate of the proportion of linked families was 0% (95% Cl 0–18%). Our results indicate that there is a gene(s) other than BRCA1 which predisposes to early–onset breast cancer in women and which confers a higher risk of male breast cancer. Identification of additional pedigrees that include cases of male breast cancer may therefore facilitate the mapping and isolation of this gene. © 1994 Nature Publishing Group.},

Ninety‐four per cent were positive for oestrogen receptor, 93% for progesterone receptor and 57% for androgen receptor. Eight patients had hormonal treatment for advanced disease and five (62.5%) responded. Duration of response ranged from six months to 23 months. There appeared to be no clear relationship between hormone receptor status or quantitative receptor level and response to treatment in this small series. It is unlikely that oestrogen and progesterone receptors will be of value as discriminators because of their high incidence and it is suggested that further study of androgen receptor is indicated.

	abstract = {Breast cancer in the male is an uncommon disease, occurring less than 1% as often as in females. Because of its rarity, this disease has not been as extensively studied as its female counterpart. Male breast cancer is evaluated and managed in a fashion very similar to that for female breast cancer. Primary management in early stage disease is usually a modified radical mastectomy. First line hormonal therapy for metastatic disease, in our institution, is tamoxifen for patients with positive estrogen receptors. Second line therapy consists of progestins or antiandrogens/LHRH analogs. No firm recommendations can be made concerning adjuvant systemic therapy. However, it is likely that studies from female patients are adaptable. Unfortunately, carcinoma of the male breast is such an infrequently encountered tumor that unfamiliarity with the disease can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment. An increased awareness of the disease may be expected to result in earlier detection and institution of therapy at a stage when cure may be possible.

	abstract = {A case-control study was conducted in Los Angeles County, CA, of 75 male breast cancer cases aged 20–74 yr at diagnosis to investigate the role of a number of suspected risk factors. The study involved both interviews and laboratory measurements. Factors under study included fertility and marital history, obesity, alcohol and cigarette consumption, use of drugs known or suspected of causing gynecomastia, family history of breast cancer, history of radiation exposure to the upper body, sex chromatin analysis, serum levels of prolactin, testosterone, estrone, estradiol and sex-hormone-binding globulin, as well as urinary levels of estrone, estradiol, and estriol. Two patients versus no controls tested positive for sex chromatin and were excluded from further analyses. The only statistically significant risk factor identified was greater weight of the cases at age 30; a man who weighed 80 or more kg at age 30 had twice the risk of breast cancer of a man weighing less than 60 kg at that age. Serum estrone levels were positively, and sex-hormone-binding globulin levels were negatively, related to body weight, and we interpret the greater weight of the cases as suggesting that the underlying risk factor is an increased exposure to bioavailable estrogen. None of the differences observed between cases and controls for either the serum or urinary hormone levels was, however, statistically significant and there did not appear to be any large absolute excess of estrogens or deficit of testosterone in the cases. This apparent contradiction may be explained by the fact that there was little difference in weight between the cases and controls at the time of sampling. © 1988, American Association for Cancer Research.

	abstract = {Background. Cancer of the male breast (MBC) is rare, accounting for less than 1% of cancer in males and representing less than 1% of all breast cancers. Reports of abnormalities in the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in MBC have been few. Methods. To assess the expression and mutations of the p53 gene, 35 patients with 36 MBC (one patient with bilateral breast carcinoma) were examined using immunohistochemical methods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. Results. Thirty‐one of the 36 carcinomas were studied by immunohistochemistry and by the PCR‐based approach. Five patients were studied by immunohistochemistry only. Twelve patients (41.4%) of the 29 studied by molecular analysis presented an altered pattern in the single strand conformation polymorphism gel and point mutations were confirmed in all by direct DNA sequencing. Thirty‐six tumors were studied by immunohistochemistry and 2 (5.5%) patients showed overexpression of the p53 protein. There were no statistically significant differences in p53 status with respect to: age, stage, estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, tumor type. Patients with normal p53 showed a predisposition, although not statistically significant, for a longer disease free survival (5.6 years versus 4.2 years) and overall survival (5.9 years versus 4.8 years) than did patients with genetically altered p53. Conclusions. The incidence of male patients detected with p53 mutations (41.4%) in this series is concordant with the incidence of p53 mutations in female breast cancer, supporting the idea that cancer of the male breast is similar to the female counterpart.

	abstract = {Occupational exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (MF) was studied in 56 male subjects with breast cancer (adenocarcinoma) diagnosed in 1985-91, and 144 subjects with testicular cancer (seminoma and non-seminoma), diagnosed in 1985-87. The cases were compared with 1,121 control subjects from a previous case-control study on MF and cancer. Exposure assessment was based on the job held longest during the decade before diagnosis linked to a job exposure matrix based on MF measurements. The results refer to an estimated average mean of > 0.28 μT (Q4) and > 0.40 μT (P90, part of Q4) with ≤ 0.15 μT (Q1) as reference. For breast cancer, the odds ratios (OR) and the 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) were 0.7 (CI = 0.3-1.9) and 0.7 (CI = 0.2-2.3), respectively. For men 60 years or younger, the corresponding estimates were OR = 0.9 (CI = 0.2-4.5) and 1.5 (CI = 0.3-8.3). For testicular cancer, the ORs were 1.3 (CI = 0.7-2.5) and 2.1 (CI = 1.0-4.3), and for men 40 years or younger the ORs were 1.9 (CI = 0.8-4.4) and 3.9 (CI = 1.4-11.2). The results were mainly attributable to non-seminoma, the more malignant type of testicular cancer. Our conclusion is that the results for male breast cancer, based on limited numbers, fail to support the suggested association with MF exposure. The results for testicular cancer gave some support to the hypothesis of a hormonal link between MFs and cancer, and should be further explored.},

The patients were followed for a median of 67 months (range, 0.5 to 14.4 years). Analysis of the frequency distribution by stage showed that 16 (17%) patients were stage 0 and 26 (27%) patients were stage 1. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 18 weeks (mean, 5 weeks; range, 1 to 156 weeks). Modified radical mastectomy was undertaken in 71 (67%) patients. The actuarial 5-year relapse-free survival for the entire group was 68% and the actuarial 5-year overall survival was 85%. Relapse-free survival at 5 years for axillary node-negative patients was 87% and for node- positive patients was 30% (p < 0.001). Overall survival figures for the same subsets showed a 5-year survival of 100% for the node-negative subset and 60% for the node-positive subset. On multivariate analysis, the most powerful predictor of outcome in men was the status of the axillary lymph nodes, and the only prognostic factor that added significantly to this predictive power was the duration of symptoms. Patients who sought treatment less than 6 months after the onset of symptoms experienced a significant survival advantage when compared with patients whose symptoms were present for more than 6 months (p = 0.03). The profile of the stages at diagnosis, the treatment approach, and the survival rates approximate those reported in series of female breast cancers, and overall, the two diseases are remarkably similar.},

DNA probes specific for repetitive pericentromeric regions on chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 18, X, and Y were used to determine chromosome copy numbers in interphase tumor cells. Copy number distributions varied greatly between chromosomes, showing major tumor populations with one (Y), two (X, 9), three (11, 15, 18), and four (1, 7, 17) copies of the pericentromeric targets. The X chromosome was present in two copies in 84.7% of tumor nuclei, with the balance being primarily monosomic. Normal skin fibroblasts cultured from the same patient showed 99% monosomy X. The Y chromosome showed a minor population (12%) with two copies. The DNA index of the tumor was 2.0 as determined by flow cytometry. The proliferative activity of the tumor cells was simultaneously analyzed using detection of in vivo bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. The BrdU labeling index was 13.2%. © 1991.},

Treatment was started with the combined administration of an LHRH agonist and the pure antiandrogen Flutamide. Six and a half months later, bone scintigraphy was normal while serum testosterone was reduced to 10% of control and the serum concentration of the adrenal steroids was decreased by 23 to 45%. Following relapse of the disease at 12 months, more complete blockade of adrenal steroid secretion was achieved with aminoglutethimide and hydrocortisone. Stability of the disease was then observed up to the last evaluation performed in January 1990 (5 years of stable disease). Since the adrenal steroids are converted into active androgens and estrogens in peripheral tissues, including the breast, the combined therapy has the advantage of reducing the source of potentially active estrogens and androgens while blocking the action of androgens in target tissues. No side-effects other than those due to hypoandrogenicity, namely hot flushes and loss of libido and potency were observed. This well-tolerated treatment achieves complete medical castration, partial medical adrenalectomy, and neutralization of peripheral androgen action.},

The best yield of intact nuclei was obtained from lymph node tissue. The prevalence rate of KS in males with breast cancer was found to be 7.5 per cent, a much higher rate than previously reported (approximately 3 per cent). Methodological differences are suggested to cause the increased prevalence rate. Based on our finding and on the prevalence of KS in the normal population as well as on the incidence of MBC, a 50-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in males with KS relative to normal males was found. The same median age at diagnosis, 72 years, was established for both groups of patients. No differences in survival were seen.},

	abstract = {Background. Male breast cancer (MBC) is considered an androgen‐dependent tumor, and as in prostatic cancer, responses have been reported with use of antian‐drogens or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone analogs. Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that better results could be achieved by combining these two agents. Methods. Eleven men with recurrent or progressive carcinoma of the breast have been treated with buserelin 1500 μg subcutaneously daily in the first week and 600 μg daily subsequently and cyproterone acetate (CPA) 100 mg twice a day orally starting 24 hours before the first dose of buserelin. Results. Objective responses have been observed in seven patients with a median duration of 11.5 months (range, 9–24+ months). Responses were not correlated to the dominant site of disease. Three patients had stable disease lasting 5 months. Median survival was 18.5 months. Side effects primarily were decrease or loss of libido, impotence, and hot flushes. Conclusions. Total androgen blockade with buserelin and CPA seems effective in the treatment of patients with advanced cancer of the male breast, but its superiority over standard androgen suppression remains to be demonstrated.

	abstract = {Background: Previous studies have provided conflicting results concerning the familial effect of male breast cancer on breast cancer risks in female relatives. Purpose: We studied breast cancer risks in first-degree relatives of male patients and compared them with relatives of female patients. Methods: Our study included 88 consecutively ascertained male patients and 320 of their first-degree relatives as well as 186 consecutively ascertained female patients and 633 of their first-degree relatives. Observed numbers of breast cancers in relatives were compared with the expected number derived from the Connecticut Tumor Registry. Multiple logistic regression analysis was also performed. Results: Relatives of male patients exhibited a significant twofold increased risk when comparedwith expected rates and no difference in risk when compared with that of relatives of female patients. Prostate; cancer in the family of a male patient, resulted in a significant fourfold increased breast cancer risk compared with a risk of 1.4 in families with no history of prostate cancer. A family: history of lung cancer, colon cancer, or melanoma had no effect on increasing risks of breast cancer. Conclusion: The familial effect of male breast cancer is the same as that of female breast cancer. Implications: Any estimates of breast cancer risk provided to individuals should also consider the occurrence of prostate cancer in the family, since prostate cancer appears capable of at least doubling the underlying twofold risk.

Despite this, patients are often first seen with tumors that have metastasized to the axillary nodes, which markedly decreases the survival rate. Therapy of localized disease includes simple excision, modified radical mastectomy, and radical mastectomy, but there is no consensus for which operation is appropriate. Radiation therapy should be strongly considered in patients with metastases to the axillary nodes, but the role of adjuvant hormonal therapy or chemotherapy is unclear. For treatment of disseminated disease, tamoxifen seems to be replacing orchiectomy. The favorable response rate, especially in patients with estrogen-receptor-positive tumors, the lack of side effects, and the high level of patient acceptability make it an attractive therapeutic choice.},

The dissociation constant and number of binding sites were both very similar to those in the female counterpart. In one of the patients, the number of binding sites in the metastatic lesions of the liver was similar to that in the primary site. The patient responded well to endocrine ablation therapy with a remission period of 8 mth. The estrogen receptor was found to be positive in 12 out of 14 cases of male breast cancer reported previously including the present 2 patients. Three out of 4 cases with positive receptor content, including the present case, responded to orchiectomy.},

	abstract = {Estrogen receptors (ER) were present in tumor specimens from 29 of 34 cases of male breast cancer. There was a significant negative correlation of ER concentration with age. The quantity of ER tended to correlate directly with progesterone receptor levels, disease-free interval, and response duration among responders, but not to a statistically significant extent. In 13 patients for whom response data were available, no significant correlation was observed between ER levels and either frequency or duration of orchiectomy response. Among the six patients with tumor ER levels of less than 30 fmol per mg of protein, however, only two brief responses to orchiectomy occurred that were of little clinical benefit, while three of seven patients with higher ER responded more favorably. Thus, although this suggests that a relationship between low ER and unfavorable orchiectomy response may emerge as more patients are studied, currently available data do not justify basing therapeutic intervention on ER status of a biopsy in a manner analogous to that used for female breast cancer. Nine of 14 male breast cancer patients had positive progesterone receptor assays and several had androgen or glucocorticoid receptors. Tissue from only three of ten men with gynecomastia had measurable ER, and these were limited to the 4S component on sucrose gradients. © 1980, American Association for Cancer Research.

Male breast carcinoma comprised 0.8% of all breast carcinomata in Denmark. The average age was 65.2 years, which is considerably higher than in women. The median duration of symptoms was 6 months. In only 13% was a palpable tumour the single symptom present on referral. In 27% ulceration was found on admission. However, ulceration was not, as commonly supposed, a particularly early manifestation of male breast cancer. It has been proved that ulceration is significantly related to duration of symptoms and size of tumour. According to the TNM classification, 35% of 253 cases were in stage I, 11% in stage II, 42% in stage III and 12% in stage IV. There was a significant correlation between the duration of symptoms and the clinical stage, and the histological degree of malignancy and the clinical stage.

Expressed by corrected survival rate, the prognosis appears to be somewhat more favourable during the period 1958-71 than during the period 1943-57. This improvement of prognosis can be related to a significantly better clinical stage of advancement during the latter period. Comparison of the 5-year corrected survival rates in series of male and female breast cancer shows that the prognosis in male breast cancer is not much worse than the prognosis in females. It has been proved that the duration of disease, the clinical stage and the histological degree of malignancy influence the prognosis considerably. The therapeutic results in our series correspond well with the results found in other series. We did not find any evidence to indicate that it would be better to carry out radical mastectomy than to do simple mastectomy since radical mastectomy has not given consistently better results.

Among the 187 patients, a total of 30 cases of special cancer types were found (22 carcinomas and 8 sarcomas). There were no carcinomas of lobular type. The sarcomas in our series had a relatively high frequency and a favorable prognosis. Histologic grading was carried out in 150 carcinomas. The 30 cases of special types and 7 cases with insufficient tumor tissue were excluded. The distribution of the 150 cases was: 29% with Grade I, 54% with Grade II, and 17% with Grade III. The histologic grading was correlated with prognosis, and a significant fall in the 5‐year survival rate was found from Grade I to II and from Grade II to III.

Chromosome analysis of peripheral blood revealed the chromosomal constitution normally found in the Klinefelter syndrome. By pooling series of cases of male breast cancer, in which systematical screening for sex chromatin was made, it was found that 9 out of 242 patients were sex chromatin positive, which is a higher number than that found in the normal male population. Calculated on the basis of the incidence of breast cancer in women and men, and of the incidence of sex chromatin positive individuals in the normal male population, the incidence of breast cancer among patients with the Klinefelter syndrome was found to be about one fifth of the incidence of breast cancer in women and about twenty times the incidence of breast cancer in normal men. The breast carcinoma found in the sex chromatin positive patient in our material presented no special histological features. Testicular histology showed a pattern different from that normally found in the Klinefelter syndrome, since no totally hyalinized a‐cellular tubules, which are considered pathognomonic for the Klinefelter syndrome, could be demonstrated. © 1973 Acta Pathologica, Microbiologica et Immunologica Scandinavica},

None of the eight patients with intraductal or intracystic carcinoma died of cancer. Survival of the entire group of men with invasive carcinoma was 40% after ten years. The ten year survival for men with negative nodes was 79%, for men with positive nodes 11%. Comparison with a series of 304 women with breast cancer operated on at Memorial Hospital in 1960 revealed no difference with regard to incidence of positive axillary lymph nodes or stage of disease. There was, however, a significantly lower survival rate for men. This poorer prognosis was limited to those men with pathologically positive axillary nodes.},

Two samples of metastatic cancers were obtained from a single patient 6 month apart. Receptors were assayed by measuring the binding affinity of cytosol fractions for 3H oestradiol 17β. Saturable binding sites were obtained in 6 primary and 1 metastatic cancer. The dissociation constant of the binding reactions were within the range reported for the specific oestrogen receptors from female breast cancers. When present, receptor concentrations varied from 59 to 532 fmoles/mg tissue protein. Competition studies of the binding of 3H oestradiol 17β by excess amounts of unlabelled steroid hormones or antihormones revealed that the receptors were specific for oestrogens and antioestrogens. By all these criteria, receptors from male mammary cancer were identical to those from female breast cancer. Chromosome analysis was performed in 6 patients. All had a normal 46 XY male pattern indicating that no conspicuous genetic abnormalities such as those of the Klinefelter syndrome seemed responsible for the presence of the receptors.},

	abstract = {In order to elucidate the question of whether or not gynecomastia is a premalignant state, a Danish series comprising 265 cases of male breast cancer was reviewed with regard to a previous history of gynecomastia and the finding of clinical gynecomastia on admission. Furthermore, preparations from 187 cases of the same series were assessed with a view to the presence of histologically verified gynecomastia. In 10 patients there was a history of gynecomastia; only one patient presented clinical gynecomastia on admission. In 79 cases there was sufficient breast tissue for a histological study; this revealed gynecomastia in 21 cases, 6 of which were of florid type (type I) and 15 of quiescent fibrous type (type II). In 2 cases ducts with severe atypia of the epithelium were found, but in spite of investigations of serial sections no transition into invasive growth was revealed. It is concluded that the following features seem to support the theory that gynecomastia, may be a premalignant state: A, the finding of severe atypia of the epithelium in the ducts in concurrent gynecomastia and breast cancer; B. lower mean age in cases of breast cancer with concurrent gynecomastia; C. the higher ratio of male to female breast cancer and the low mean age of the male patients in an area with a high frequency of gynecomastia; D. heavily increased frequency of breast cancer in patients with the Klinefelter syndrome. © 1973 Acta Pathologica, Microbiologica et Immunologica Scandinavica},

	abstract = {This study comprises 27 cases of male breast cancer treated at the University Hospital from 1966 through 1978. Its incidence was 0.53% of all cancer in males and 3.2% of all mammary cancers. Mean age was 52 years old. Lump in the breast was the commonest presenting feature in all patients followed by skin ulceration in 44.4% of cases. The average duration of symptoms was 16 months. Twenty‐five patients had infiltrating duct carcinoma and two had papillary carcinoma. Two cases were in stage I, 10 in stage II, 11 in stage III, and 4 in stage IV. Of the 12 patients in stages I and II who underwent radical mastectomy, the axillary lymph nodes were pathologically negative in stage I and positive in stage II. The nodes were clinically involved in stages III and IV. Simple mastectomy followed by radiotherapy were used in stage III cancer and all patients in stage IV cancer had only biopsy and palliative chemotherapy. Bilateral orchidectomy followed by estrogen gave only marginal benefit in terms of survival and objective regression. Only four patients, two each in stages I and II, are alive and well for more than five years. These include two cases of papillary carcinoma. Poor prognosis in this series was exclusively determined by axillary lymph node involvement, although other factors such as shorter span of symptoms, younger age group, higher incidence of skin involvement, and invasive nature of carcinoma also appear to be significant.

	abstract = {The modalities used to treat 27 male patients with metastatic breast cancer at Memorial Hospital from 1957–1979 are reviewed. The overall objective orchiectomy response rate was 48% (11/23). The median response was 11 months (6–96 months). The median survival in responders was 58 months, whereas the median survival in orchiectomy failures was 24 months. Four patients had estrogen receptor protein determinations (ERP). Two positive ERP patients and one borderline ERP patient responded (18–34 months). One ERP‐negative patient failed orchiectomy. The number of major ablations in this series (two responses/two adrenalectomies, two failures/two hypophysectomies) does not permit conclusions, although review of the literature suggests that major ablation may be valuable in patients responding to orchiectomy. Two of three patients who refused ablative therapy responded (three months, ten months) to single agent provera. Administering stilbesterol to the ten‐month responder and to the patient who failed provera resulted in two additional responses (four months, continuing, and 22 months). Of six patients who failed orchiectomy and subsequently received chemotherapy, four patients responded (7–40 months). The median survival in these patients was 40 months (33–44 months). This review supports the importance of orchiectomy in the treatment of metastatic male breast cancer. Although the numbers are small, these data suggest that estrogen receptor determinations may be useful in selecting patients for orchiectomy. Selective additive hormone therapy may be useful in patients who refuse orchiectomy. Chemotherapy may provide worthwhile palliation in patients who fail orchiectomy.
